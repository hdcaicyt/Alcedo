# COMMENTS
- at the end of volumes 1 &3 there are 'addiciones & correcciones' sections
- at the end of vol 5 there are sections for 'provincias' and 'vocabulario'
- the Diccionario is of place names, not places really. A name can refer to several places, from a nearby river to a settlement in another country.
- some entries have very large text sections with details about people, events (lists of OBISPOS, CAPITANES, etc)
