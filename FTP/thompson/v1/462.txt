[whole crop. It is not, however, pretended that
the greatest part, or even a very large proportion,
of the cane land throughout the island, is equally
productive. The general average produce for a
series of years is 16,000 hogsheads of 16 cwt.
which, as one-half only of the w hole cane land, or
8500 acres, is annually cut, (the remainder being
in young canes), gives nearly two hogsheads of 16
cwt. per acre for (he whole of the land in ripe
canes; but even this is a prodigious return, not
equalled, perhaps, by any other sugar country in
any part of the globe.

==[[In the report of the privy council in 1788]]==, the
British property vested here is estimated at 43,726

acres of patented estates, and 26,000 Negroes, at
50Z. each Negro. The same report, in a general
appraisement of British property vested in the Bri-
tish colonies, makes the land, buildings, and stock,
double the value of the Negroes ; and the towns,
stores, and shipping about of the land, &c.
In 1770 the exports amounted to above 419,000/.
sterling, in sugar, molasses, and rum ; and near
8000/. for cotton. Besides cotton, ginger, and the
tropical fruits, it produced, in 1787, 231,397 cwt.
of sugar; and in 1790, but about 113,000 cwt.
The produce of this article varies from 8000 to
17,000 hogsheads of 13 cwt.

==[[By return to house of commons]]==, 1806, the Exports of Sugar from St. Christopher’s amounted,

==[[As In The Other British Islands In The Neighbour 
Hood|As in the other British islands in the neighbour-
hood]]==, all the white men from the age of 16 to 60
are obliged to enlist in the milita, and in this island
they serve without pay. They form two regi-
ments of foot, although the whole number of ef-
fective men in each regiment seldom exceeds 300 ;
but there is likewise a company of free blacks, and
this, before the late war, constituted the whole of
the military force within the island. Indeed, its
natural strength, from the conformation and in-
equalities of its furface, is such, that a garrison of
2000 effective troops, properly supplied with am-

munition and provisions, would in all human pro-
bability render it impregnable to the most formi-
dable invasion.

==[[The Gazette Of November 1st|The Gazette of November 1st]]==, 1811, contains
what has hitherto been considered as unprece-
dented : — A statement of every person’s income,
according as he is rated to the income tax. Pos-
sessors of sugar-estates pay 6«. on every ton of
sugar ; and others, when their incomes, inde-
pendent of such estates, amount to 200/. currency,
are to pay 1/. per cent.
