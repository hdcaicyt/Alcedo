==[[Half A Century Had Now Elapsed Since The Dis 
Covery Of [[Brasil|Brazil]]|Half a century had now elapsed since the dis-
covery of Brazil]]==, and so much capital in' the course
of that time had been vested there, that these colo-
nies began to be regarded as possessions of consi-
derable importance. The evils of the present sys-
tem of government were very great : the governor
of every captaincy exercised uncontrolled authority,
and consequently abused it; the property and ho-
nour and lives of the colonists were at the mercy
of these lords ; and the people groaned under
their intolerable oppression. Their complaints
reached the king ; he took into consideration the
advantages which the country promised, espe-
cially from the cultivation of sugar, and the danger
there was, lest the French should succeed in es-
tablishing themselves there, and in winning the
natives to their party ; and he resolved to revoke
the powers of the several captains, leaving them in
possession of their grants, and to appoint a gover-
nor-general, with full authority, civil and cri-
minal.

1. A governor- general appointed. — The person
appointed to this high station was Thome de Sousa,
a fidalgo, though a bastard, who had been tried
and approved in the African and Indian wars.

2. The jirst Jesuits .—\w the same year the Je-
suits, who liave borne so great a part in the history
of S. America, first made their appearance. The
names of these primary adventurers were. Father
Juan de Aspilcueta, Father Antonio Fires, Father
Leonardo Nunes, and the lay brethren, Vincente
Rodriguez and Diogo Jacome. The following in-
stances of the barbarous customs of the natives
will give an idea of the ignorance of the minds
they had to cultivate. We are informed, that
whilst preparations were making for the death of a
captive, a woman was appointed to watch him, and
to cohabit with him, the captor not scrupling thus
to bestow his sister or his daughter. If she be-
came pregnant this was what they wished. It was
their opinion that the child proceeded wholly
from the father, receiving nutrition, indeed, and
birth from the mother, but nothing more. This
opinion produced a horrible consequence ; the olF-
spring of a captive was suffered to grow up, the
circumstances of his birth-place and up-growing
occasioned no human feelings towards him ; it was
always remembered that he was of the blood and
flesh of their enemies, and when they thought him
in the best condition they killed and devoured him ;

the nearest kinsman to the mother officiated as
slaughterer, and the first mouthful was given to
the mother herself. But human nature partakes
too much of that goodness from which it hath pro-
ceeded, ever to become totally perverted. The
women often took drugs to cause abortion, that
they might be spared the misery of seeing their off-
spring butchered ; and they often assisted these
husbands to escape, laid food for them in the woods,
and sometimes fled with them. This happened
frequently to the Portuguese prisoners ; the Brazi-
lians held it dishonourable to fly, and could not
always be persuaded to save themselves. A mother
also was sometimes found who resolutely defended
her child, till he was able to make his way to his
father’s tribe. But the native [[Brasil|Brazil]]ians were not
all cannibals. The Tupi race seem to have brought
this custom from the interior, and it is found in all
the branches of that stock.

3. Guarani and Tupi languages. — The Tupis
of [[Brasil|Brazil]], the Guaranis of Paraguay, and the
Omaguas of [[Peru]], (between whom and the nearest
Guaranis there intervenes, as Hervas says, a chaos
of nations), speak dialects of the same tongue,
traces of which are found through an extent ot'70
degrees. The Guarani is the parent language, be-
ing the most artificial ; as the Greek is more so
than the Latin, the Latin than all the modern
dialects w hich have grown out of its ruins. It
bears the marks of a primitive tongue, for it
abounds with monosyllables ; one word, as in the
Chinese, serves for various meanings, as it is
variously accented ; and every word is said to ex-
plain itself, which probably means that many aro
imitative sounds, and that all composites and deri-
vatives are regularly formed . Y et from the variety
of its accentuations, it is the most difficult of all
the American languages. The Tupi is spoken
along the whole coast of [[Brazil]], and far into the in-
terior, probably extending over a wider surface
than any other of the native American languages.
Their names for the numerals were very barbarous,
and extended only as far as five ; all beyond wai
expressed by help of the fingers. Tupa is their
word for father, for the Supreme Being, and for
thunder ; it past by an easy procees from the first
of these meanings to the last, and the barbarous
vanity of some tribes compounded from it a name
for themselves. In these words their whole theology
is at once comprised and explained.

4. Tupi priests. — T\\e\x payes, or priests, lived
alone in dark huts, the doors of which were very
small, and into which no one dared enter. What-
ever they wanted was given them. They taught
that it was an abominable sin for any one to refuse]
