lar way by a river of its name. It abounds in
large alligators and mosquitoes, which render its
navigation very troublesome. Its shores are co-
vered with beautiful trees, which are inhabited by
a variety of birds and apes of several species, which
make an incredible chattering and noise. It was
by this river that the pirate John Morgan came
when he took and sacked Panama in 1670. It
was discovered by Hernando de la Serma in 1527,
when he called it the river of Lagartos, but its
mouth was before discovered by Lope de Olano
in 1510. Here are found, at certain seasons, a
very small fish of the size of a pin, called titles,
and these are so abundant, that putting into the
water a large basket, it is certain to be drawn out
full ; they are fried, and make very savoury
fritters.

==[[Cu Agre|CuAGRE]]==, with the dedicatory title of San Lo-

entrance or mouth of the former river. It has for
its defence a strong castle, which was built by the
order of Philip 11. by the famous engineer J uan
Bautista Antoneli. This was taken by the pirate
John Morgan, after having made a glorious de-
fence, in 1668, when the settlement was burnt and
sacked ; and in 1740 it was taken by the English,
commanded by Admiral Vernon, who entirely
destroyed it ; its loss in that war being supplied by
two strong batteries, which hindered the English
from making a breach, for the third time, when
they came with three frigates of war : but they
were driven back by Captain Don Juan de Her-
mida, who was formerly captain of the regiment
of Granada. In 1752 this castle was rebuilt, in the
most perfect manner, by the lieutenant-general
and engineer Don Ignatio de Sala, governor of
Cartagena, who came hither for this purpose by
order of the king. In this fortress several per-
