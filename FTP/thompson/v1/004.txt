hither many barbarous nations of Indians have re-
tired, selecting for their dwelling places the few
plains which belong to the province. The Em-
peror Y upanqui endeavoured to make it subser-
vient to his controul, but without success : the same
disappointment awaited Pedro de Andia in his
attempt to subjugate it in the year 1538.

==[[Abismes|ABISMES]]==, Quartel des, that part or divi-
sion of the island of [[Guadaloupe]] which looks to
the n. e. It takes its name from its having some
creeks, or inlets, which serve as places of shelter
for vessels, in case of invasion either from enemies
or from hurricanes. Here they ride quite safe,
for the bottom is very good ; and being made fast
to the strong palm-trees which abound here, they
stand in no need of being anchored, which would
be inconvenient, and attended with risk, on ac-
count of the thick roots thrown out by the
above trees. Further on is a small island called
Des Cochons, where an engineer, of the name of
Renau, endeavoured, without success, in 1700, to
build a fort, for the sake of securing the harbour,
which is a good one.

==[[Abitanis|ABITANIS]]==, a mountain of the province and
torregimiento of Lipes in [[Peru]]. In the Quechu-
an tongue it signifies the ore of gold, from a cele-
brated mine which is at present nearly abandoned,

ous to thewsettlement of Colcha.

tainship of Espiritu Santo, between the rivers
Percipe and Quororupa, in s. lat. 18° 19' 30".
w. long. 39° 51° 30". Here are some hidden rocks,
or sand-banks, extremely dangerous ; and al-
though there are various navigable channels, it
requires the utmost caution to avoid shipwreck,
this having been the lot of an infinite number of
vessels. These sand-banks are more than 20
leagues distant from the continent, and extend
themselves upwards of five leagues to the e. of the
island of [[Tuego]]. Their situation, taken in the
the centre, is in 170° 51' 20" s. lat. w. lonar. 39°
18'.

district are found many huacas, or sepulchres of
