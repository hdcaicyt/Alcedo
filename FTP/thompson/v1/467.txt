==[[Chun Cll Os|CHUNCllOS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians,
Â«f the province and government of [[Tarma]] in [[Peru]],

and much dreaded by the Spaniards, on account
of the repeated incursions made by those savages
on their possessions. In Lima they are in a con-
tinal state of fear and apprehension of some sud-
den attack from these enemies ; for in 1742 they
took and destroyed several settlements and estates,
killing many Franciscan monks who were mis-
sionaries amongst them. They were, however,
once attacked by the brigadier, the Marquis de
Mena Hermosa, general of Callao, who construct-
ed some forts, which are still served with artillery
and troops sufficient to protect them. These In-
dians have a chief or prince, called the chuncho,
descended, according to their accounts, from the
royal race of the Incas, who would fain lay
claim to the monarchy of [[Peru]] as his right; and
accordingly, in 1744, represented to the Marquis
of Villa Garcia, not without great threats, his in-
tention of doing himself justice by force of arms :
he is a Catholic, and has added to h is own honours the
title of King of Peru ; he was brought up at Lima
amongst the Spaniards as the son of a cazique,
where he was instructed in the rules of government,
policy, and military tactics, which he introduced
into his own country, and made known the use
of swords and fire-arms. He went to Rome dis-
guised as a menial, was introduced to the court of
Madrid, where he kissed the hand of King Philip
V. and the foot of the Pontiff Clement XII. He
has two sons well instructed and equal in mental
energies. These Chuiichos Indians are numerous,
and live, some of them, in villages, and others
scattered over the mountains and in the woods ;
they maintain a secret correspondence with the
"Indians of all the other settlements of Peru and
Quito, as well as with the Christians and infidels
inhabiting the forests where missions are establish-
ed ; by tliis means they know vvhat is passing in
all the provinces, cities, and settlements, &c.
Many Indians who are malcontents, or fugitives
from justice on account oferimeordebt, invariably
betake themselves to the Chunchos, and this is the
reason why this nation is so very populous. The
viceroy of Peru uses the greatest precautions, and is
continually on the alert against any movements of
the Chunchos or other Indians, and keeps a garri-
son of good troops upon his frontiers.

best troops.
