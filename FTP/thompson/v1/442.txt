==[[All of these are mountainous]]==, little cultivatad,
and produce only a small proportion of wheat,
barley, flax, and papas ^ esteemed the best of any
in America ; besides some swine, of which hams
are made, which they cure by frost, and are of so
delicate a flavour as not only to be highly esteemed
here, but in all other parts, both in and out of the
kingdom, and are in fact a very large branch of
commerce. The principal trade, however, con-
sists in planks of several exquisite woods, the trees
of which are so thick, that from each of them ars
cut in general 600 planks, of 20 feet in length,
and of 1| foot in width. Some of these trees
have measured 24 yards in circumference. The
natives make various kinds of woollen garments,
such as ponchos f quilts, coverlids, baizes, and bor~
dillos. The whole of this province is for the most
part poor ; its natives live very frugally, and with
little communication with any other part of the
world, save with those who are accustomed to come
hither in the fleet once a-year. Altliough it has
some small settlements on the continent, in Val-
divia, yet these are more than 20 or 30 leagues dis-
tant from this place, and are inhabited by infidel
Indians. These islands abound in delicate shell-
fish of various kinds, and in a variety of other
fish ; in the taking of which the inhabitants are
much occupied, and on which they chiefly sub-
sist. This jurisdiction is bounded on the n. by
the territory of the ancient city of Osorno, which
was destroyed by the Araucanian Indians, by
the extensive Archipelagoes of Huayaneco and
Huaytecas, and others which reach as far as the
straits of Magellan and the Terra del Fuego, e.
by the cordilleras and the Patagonian country, and
w. by the Pacific or S. sea. On its mountains are
found amber, and something resembling gold dust,
which is washed up by the rains, although no
