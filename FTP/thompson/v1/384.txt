tilizes the valley which gives it its name ; and runs
30 leagues, collecting the waters of many other
streams, mountain floods, and rivulets, which aug-
ment it to such a degree as to render the fording of
it impracticable just where it enters the sea.

==[[Chicamocha|CHICAMOCHA]]==, a river of the province and
corregimiento of [[Tunja]] in the Nuevo Reyno de
Granada. It rises in the paramo or mounlain-
desert of Albarracin, between that city and the
city of Santa Fe, on the 7i. side : when it passes
through Tunja, being then merely a rivulet, it has
the name of the river of Gallinazos, which it after-
wards changes for that of Sogamoso ; and for that
of Chia, Avhen it passes through this settlement.
It is afterwards called Chicamocha, and passes
through various provinces, until it becomes incor-
porated with the Magdalena, into which it enters
in one large mouth. A little before this it forms
a good port, called De la Tora, where there was
formerly a settlement, but which is at present in
a state of utter ruin.

==[[Chicanam|CHICANAM]]==, a small river of the province and
colony of [[Surinam]], or the part of Guayana pos-
sessed by the Dutch. It is one of those which

==[[Chichas V Tarija|CHICHAS V Tarija]]==, a province and correg/-
miertto of [[Peru]] ; bounded on the n. by that of
Ginti, s. by that of Tucuman, the river called

==[[Quiaca serving as the line of division]]==, vo. by that
of Lipes, and n. by that of Porco. The district of
Tarija belonging to this corregimiento, which is 40
leagues distant from the capital of Chichas, is
bounded e. by the territories of the infidel Chiri-
guanos, Chanaes, and Mataguayos Indians, to the
first settlements of which from the last habitations
of Tarija there is a narrow, craggy, and mountain-
ous route of 14 leagues in length. It is also
bounded on the n. and w. by the valley of Pilaya,
and on the s, by the jurisdiction of Xuxui. The
district of [[Chichas]] is 140 leagues in circumference,
and that of Tarija 80, being either of them inter-
sected by some extensive seiTanias : in the boun-
daries of the former there are many farms and
estates for breeding cattle, where are also produced
potatoes, maize, wheat, barley and other grain,
likewise some wine. Here are mines of gold and
silver, which were formerly very rich ; it having
been usual for the principal ones to yield some
thousand marks in each caxon ; this being espe-
cially the case in the mines of Nueva Chocaya,
which still yield to this da}-- 60 or 60 marks. Many
of the metals found in these mines are worked up
for useful purposes. The mines of Chilocoa have,
on the Whole, been most celebrated fortlieir riches.
The rivers, which are of some note, are that of
Supacha, which flows down from the cordillera of
Lipes, and running e. passes through the middle of
the province until it enters the valley of Cinti, of
the province of [[Pilaya]] and Paspaya ; and another,
called Toropalca, which enters the province of
Porco, and passes on to the same part of Cinti.
The inhabitants of this district amount to 6200.
In the settlement of Tatasi both men and women
are subject to a distressing lunacy, which causes
them to run wildly and heedlessly over the moun-
tains, without any regard to the precipices which
lie in their way ; since it has generally been ob-
served that they dash themselves headlong down :
if, however, it should happen that they are not
killed, the fall, they say, frequently restores them
to a sane mind. The observation, that the animals
of this country, namely, \\ie vicunas and the native
sheep, are subject to this malady, is without founda-
tion ; but it is thought to arise from the peculiar
eflluviasof the minerals abounding here, and which
have a great tendency to cause convulsions. The
women of tlie aforesaid settlement, when about to
bring forth children, like to be delivered of them
in the low parts of the qiiebradas, or deep glens.
The settlements of this province are,
