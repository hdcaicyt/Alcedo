on the s. as far as the mountains of Los Zaraucos,
having in this part a level territory of upwards of
40 leagues long, covered with forests,and in which
is found abundance of wild cinnamon trees, honey,
■wax, resins, and precious balsams ; numbers of
stags, tigers, bears, wild boars, and various other
quadrupeds and venomous reptiles. This country
is watered by many rivers, which flow down from
the mountains, and run from e. to w. forming large
lakes, which abound in excellent fish, and parti-
cularly in tortoises. The climate is very hot and
moist : the natives are of a good stature, well made
and robust, but extremely indolent. They obtained
the name of chiquitos, or little, from the Spaniards,
who upon their first arrival in the country were
struck with the lowness of their doors or entrances
into their houses, it being necessary to craAvl in
and out of them on all fours : this is a plan they
seem to have adopted as a precaution against the
attacks of their enemies and wild beasts. Their
country was first entered by Nuflo de Chaves in
1557 ; and upon an attempt to reduce it to the do-
minion of Spain, the inhabitants maintained a long
and bloody conflict against the Spaniards until the
year 1690, when, induced by the preaching of the re-
gulars of the company of the Jesuits, they embraced
the Catholic faith, became reduced to the laws of
civil society, and were divided into settlements,
which these zealous ministers of the gospel con-
trived, not without incredible exertion and fatigue,
to maintain undisturbed until 1767, when they were
supplanted in their functions by the secular clergy.
The Portuguese of San Pablo have taken away
numbers of these Indians to w ork in their estates, and
this is one of the principal causes of their apparent
diminution, since they were at first innumerable.
They are composed of the following nations :

==[[All of these nations speak a different language]]==, but
are now united into settlements, having one idiom
which is familiar to them all ; although this is ex-
tremely diflBcult, the acquisition of it having
puzzled the missionaries, who were engaged in its
study for 9 or 10 years or upwards : besides the
guttural letters, and those whose sound is given by
the palate, te.eth, and lips, this language has others,
the pronunciation of which is given entirely
through the nose ; the dialect also of the men dif-
fers from that of the women. The continual mois-
ture which is prevalent here, together with the mul-
titude of trees, which stand so thick as to impede
the free circulation of the air, are the causes why
this country is peculiarly subject to epidemic dis-
orders, which carry away immense numbers of its
inhabitants ; as happened in the year 1768, when,
out of 24,000 inhabitants, more than 4000 perished.
They suffer much also from crickets, which dis-
turb their rest and destroy their clothes. Here are
also an infinite variety of spiders, some of which
are as large as a man’s fist, which live in holes,
and others of a smaller sort, which make their web
among trees, in so strong a manner as to arrest a
man on horseback in his passage : some there are
of a very small sort, whose colour is red, and whose
web is yellow and as soft as silk, but whose bite is
so venomous, that the body of the person bitten
immediately swells all over, and this is followed by
a flux of blood from the mouth, nostrils, eyes, and
nails ; though by means of these violent emotions,
the poison itself is sometimes evacuated. In the
woods are found a gr^tt variety of monkeys; some
with long beards, and so large and ugly as to strike
even the natives with horror. It has been observed,
that the people of this province seldom exceed 60
years in age, and that their life is extremely dissi-
pated ; taking at the same time into consideration
the excessive perspiration and debility caused by
their aliments, for the very meat they eat is flabby
and insipid, on account of the cattle seldom thriving
or growing fat : but with all their disadvantages
of food and climate, there never was seen amongst
them a blind, dumb, foolish, or any otherwise de-
fective person. The settlements are regularly built,
forming wide and straight streets with a square and
large market-place. The furniture of the houses
is comprised in a cotton hammoc, and some cups
and dishes, and the ornament in some maize and
