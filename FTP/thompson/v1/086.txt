==[[Apuias|APUIAS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians, of the
kingdom of [[[[Brasil|Brazil]]]], in the province and captainship
of tire Rio Janeiro. They inhabit the loftiest
mountains towards the w. and extend themselves
to the n. for many leagues. These Indians are
cruel and treacherous, and are continually at war
with the bordering nations and with the Portuguese,
to whom they do infinite mischief, from the nightly
sallies that they are accustomed to make. The
women, as well as the men, go entirely naked.
'J'hcy are given to drunkenness and luxury, re-
specting neither age nor affinity the most close,
and render themselves a terror even to their friends
and allies. They live upon the flesh of their ene-
mies, or upon fish. They are accustomed to treat
their prisoners well, that they may get fat, and
make them, for this reason, partake of their horrid
banquets. If there should be among the captives
an unfortunate female, she becomes the victim of
their brutal lust, and uniformly perishes under
their repeated and successive acts of violation, and
is thus abused till she literally breathes her last.
These Indians could never be subjected cither by
the Portuguese or by the missionaries ; for these
have always fallen a victim to their cruelty.

fAPLRE, San Fernando dp, a fettlement
formed on the right shore of the celebrated river of
this name, by some of the inhabitants of the town
of Guanare, of the province and government of
Venezuela. Allured by the fertility of the soil, they
soon obtained for their little village the title and
honours of a city. Their property consists chiefly
in oxen and mules, and they are given muck
rather to grazing than to agriculture. Their city,
witiiout being large, is pretty well built, and the
only church it has, though not a grand building,
is neat and well endowed. Population about COOO
souls.]

==[[Apure]]==, a large river of the Nuevo Reyno
de Granada; it rises in the serranias of Pamplona,
and takes the name of Uru, collecting in its chan-
nel the waters of several other streams ; namely,
that of Chitaga, which rises in the same sierra,
those of St. Domingo, Masparro, and La Portu-
guesa, in the jurisdiction of Barinas, and that of
Guarico in Caracas. Being formed of all these,
it takes the name of the Apure for upwards of 300
leagues through the extensive llanos of San Juan,
and, overwhelmed by the weight of its waters,
rushes through a forest, and empties itself into the
Aguarico, which flows in a small stream from the
province of [[Caracas]], and is not navigable until it
receives these additional waters : it then, in an un-
restrained course, runs 20 leagues further, and
enters, by very rapid streams and by three mouths,
into the Orinoco. Its rush is indeed so violent,
that, although it be there a league in width, the
Orinoco resigns its current entirely to the influence
of the waters of the Apure for upwards of a league,
when the fury of this river being somewhat abated
by dreadful whirlpools, (at which even the dex-
terous and crafty Indian has been known to shud-
der), it runs for the space of three leagues more
amicably with the Orinoco ; its waters, however,
being yet distinguishable, from their bright and
crystal appearance, until, being further commixed
by the rocks of the current of Aguarico, they be-
come at length inseparably confounded with the
sombre stream of the Orinoco. On its shores are
four settlements of the missions which were held
there by regulars of the order of the Jesuits and
others, consisting of some reductions of Indians,
established by the monks of St. Dominic. Near
the city of Pamplona is a very large bridge. On
the fi. part thisriver receives, besides those already
mentioned, those of Caparo, Suripa, Canagua,
Paguli, Cano de Guachi-quin, and Vuca; and on
the s. the Guaritico, Cano de los Setenta, and
others of little consideration, such as the Mati-
yure. In the part called La Horqueta de Apure,
