are head settlements of districts, and in 15 of these
there are parish churches. Tlie capital is of the
same name, and it is situate on the shore of a lake
enjoying a mild temperature, and well known

ber of people from the neighbouring provinces

most distant parts in canoes by the lake, or with
droves of mules on land. It lies between the rivers
Fiamanalco and Tenango, which run into the
lake, and the waters of this serve, when it is ne-
cessary, to replenish the lake of Mexico, for
which purpose there are proper sluices provided.
