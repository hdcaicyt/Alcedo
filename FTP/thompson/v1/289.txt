==[[America]]==, Laving an excellent port, three leagues
in length, and in which there are many other
small islands. On the adjoining mainland there
is a river called De Salmones, (salmon), on ac-
count of its abounding with these fish, of which
indeed great quantities are taken, as they are es-
teemed the finest species of fish of any in that part
of the world .

==[[Canta|CANTA]]==, a province and government of [[Peru]],
bounded on the n. e. and e. by Tarma, on the w.
by Chancay, partly by the corregimiento of [[Cer]]-
cado, and on the s. by Huarochiri. It is 24
leagues in length ??. to s. and 3b in width e. to w.
Its territory is generally uneven, being in the cor-
dillera. It lias some deep pits or canals, on the
sides of which, and in small spots, they sow and
cultivate vegetables, fruits, and potatoes. The
breed of cattle is by no means inconsiderable here,
and there are to be found most of the wild animals
which are natives of the sierra, namely, viciitias,
(wild goats), and sheep peculiar to these countries,
and differing from those of Europe. In this pro-
vince as well as in nearly all those of the sierra,
there is scarcely any wood for the purposes of
cooking, and this want is supplied by the use of
turf, Avhich makes a lively fire, but which is very
apt to smoke. Those parts which are called
bradas, or rugged and uneven, are very sickly,
and are subject to hvo species of maladies com-
mon to other cold climates in this country ; the
one is that of warts, which not budding in due
time, often become exceedingly troublesome, and
even dangerous ; the other of corrosive sores,
shewing themselves particularly upon the face,
and are difficult to be cured, and which are attri-
buted to the sting of an insect called uta. Some
mines of silver were formerly Avorked here, Avhich
were so abundant, tliat they used to render 200
marks each cojon, (an excavation of 20 feet square,
more or less), but these, from not being regularly
Avorked, are filled with water. Here are also two
hills of loadstone, as also some minerals of alum,
copper, and red lead. The following rivers take
their rise in this province : The Carabaya from the
lakes Tacaimbaba and Lorococha, Avliich empty
themselves into the sea on the n. of Lima ; and
the Pasaraayo, which runs to the s. of Chancay,
first receiving the waters of some hot medicitial
springs. Its corregidor used to receive a repar-
