22 of Indians. In its district is found and gathered
the celebrated plant called in the country oleacazan^
■which is considered as a wonderful restorer of lost
strength, and a certain specific against all kinds of
poison. The leaves of it are applied to the part
affected, and the natives are accustomed to judge
of its virtues by its degree of adhesion. One hun-

regimiento of Santiago in the kingdom of [[Chile]] ;

[==[[Colla|COLLA]]==, a parish of the province and govern-
ment of Buenos Ayres ; situate on a small river
near the sea-coast, about eight leagues e. of Colonia

==[[Collados|COLLADOS]]==, Ensenada de los, a bay on
the s. coast of the w. head, and in the territory of

tween the rock of Bareo and the river Damasein.

==[[Collahuas|COLLAHUAS]]==, and Asiento of Mines of
Caylloma, a province and corregwiiento of Pern ;
bounded n. by that of Cbumbivilcas, e. by that of
Canes and Canches or Tinta, s. e, by that of
Lampa, s. by that of Arequipa, and w. by that of
Camana. It is 52 leagues in length s. e. n. w. and
16 in width. Its temperature is cold, from being
situate in the cordillera ; with the exception of that
part which borders upon Camana, where it is
very mild, especially in the five leagues where its

jurisdiction extends itself in the valley of Sihuas ;
the other five leagues reaching to tlie sea bordering
on Camana. Its productions are various : those
of the valley are comprised in wine, brandies,
wheat, maize, pulse, and fruits, especially figs,
which being preserved, serve as nourishment to
numbers of poor people. The other territories of
this province are of the same temperature, though
comparatively barren. It abounds in large and
small cattle, native sheep, vicunas, and some wild
animals. The roads are dangerous, from the
country’s being extremely unequal, and the greater
part of it beinga craggy ravine, over which labours,
rather than to say runs, a pretty large river, which
has its rise within the province. Here are many
silver mines, from which great riches were formerly
extracted, since they yielded 80 or 100 marks each
caxon. Atthe present day they yield but sparingly,
on account of their great depth, some of them being
200 fathoms in descent ; they are, nevertheless,
worked with tolerable profit. The principal
mountain of these mines is that of Caylloma, and
it was through this mine that the capital was
founded. There are also not wanting mines of
gold, tin, lead, copper, and sulphur; but these, on
account of the deficiency of resources, remain un-
worked. The capital, as we have before stated, is
Caylloma. Its repartimmito used to amount to
37,100 dollars, and its alcavala to 456 dollars per
annum. The other settlements of the jurisdiction
are.

==[[Collana|COLLANA]]==, a settlement of the province and
corregimiento of [[Cicasica]] in [[Peru]] ; annexed to the
curacy of Mccapa. Its Indian inhabitants have
kept themselves unmixed from any other cast ever
since the time of the conquest ; and in order to still
preserve themselves so, they will not allow of any
strangers sleeping in the settlement, though he
should be sent by the corregidor. If any other
person should come among them, he is put into
prison, and after a very short time dispatched.
Owing to these precautions, the vicious propen-
pensities observable in other settlements are en~
