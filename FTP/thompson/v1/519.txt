One half of the city experiences in one day a va-
riation of all the winds from n. to s. These winds,
thus changing, are accompanied with great tem-
pests of thunder and lightning. At one moment
the heat which accompanies the n. wind is ex-
cessive, and at another the cold which accompanies
the s. is intolerable. It is, indeed, to this cause
that the number of sudden deaths which occur
here are attributed. The city is small, and nearly
of a square figure, but the buildings are superior
to any in the province. It has three convents ;
those of the religious order of St. Francis, St. Do-
mingo, and La Merced, an hospital of Bethleraites,
with the dedicatory title of San Roque ; two mo-
nasteries of nuns, tlie one of Santa Teresa, the other
of Santa Clara, and two colleges with the titles of
universities, it is the head of a bishopric, erected
in 1570, and is very rich, owing to the great com-
merce which it carries on in mules bought in the
province of [[Buenos]] Ayres, and fattened in the
pastures here, for the purpose of being sold for the
supply of the other provinces, and in fact of the
whole of [[Peru]]. It abounds in all kinds of pro-
ductions, and is 70 leagues from Santiago del Es-

itself into the sea, in 5° 22' n. lat. : at its entrance
