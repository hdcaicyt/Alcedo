==[[Atigouantines|ATIGOUANTINES]]==, a nation of Indians of
New France in N. America, towards the 44° of
lat. In their dwellings many families live toge-
ther, and the continual fires which they are obliged
to make produce such a quantity of smoke that
they are universally blind in old age. Their
extravagant mode of living is similar to that of
the other Indians, excepting that in their repasts,
these give a decided preference to the eye of their
victims, which they pluck out with the greatest
avidity, avowing it to be a most precious morsel.
After human flesh, they esteem most that of dogs.
Their method of curing infirmity is not less pecu-
liar, and every one of them may practise as a phy-
sician, since the same remedy is observed as is
given in Europe for the treatment of the bite of
the tarantula, namely, the endeavouring to divert
the patient by means of music and songs. It is not
known that these Indians worship any deity, but
through an impulse of terror they own a certain
respect for the devil. They nevertheless believe

in llie immortality of the soul, and promise them-
selves a place of jubilee and merriment in the
other world, persuaded also that they shall there
be united to their friends.
