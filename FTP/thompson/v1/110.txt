1790 only 479. It is distant 30 miles from Ports-
mouth, and has an academy which was founded in
1789 by the hon. N. Peabody, who endowed it
with 1000 acres of land. In this township is a
large meadow, wherein is an island of six or seven
acres, which was formerly loaded with valuable
pine timber and other forest wood. When the
meadow is overflowed by means of an artifical
dam, this island rises with the water, which is
sometimes six feet. In a pond in the middle of
the island there have been fish, which, when the
meadow has been overflowed, have appeared there
when the water has been drawn oflT, and the island
settled to its usual place. The pond is now al-
most covered with verdure. In it a pole 50 feet
long has disappeared without finding a bot-
tom.]

==[[Atlatlauca|ATLATLAUCA]]==, an alcaldia mayor
Espana, in the province and bishopric of Oaxaca.

head settlements at a small distance from each other.
It is at the same time the most barren in produc-
tions and commerce ; on which account it is the
last in reputation in the kingdom, and is thought
but little of, since! it yields scarcely sufficient to sup-
ply its own necessities. The capital has the same
name. This is situate in a hot temperature, and
contains 78 families of Zapotecas Indians. The
abundant stream of the Cuicatlan passes through
its vicinity ; but such is the sterility of the soil,
that no advantage can be derived from its waters.
It, in short, produces nothing but a moderate
quantity of maize. It is 70 leagues s.e. of
Mexico.
