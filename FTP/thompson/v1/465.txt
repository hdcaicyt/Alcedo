belongs to the bishopric of La Paz, and is so situate
as to have a fine view of the lake. It is a settle-
ment at once the most pleasant and convenient,
fertile, and abounding in fruits and cattle, but
its temperature is excessively cold. It has two
parishes, with the dedicatory title of Santo Do-
mingo and La Asuncion, and two hermitages de-
dicated to St. Barbara and St. Sebastian. The
other settlements are,

is 51 leagues in length from n. w. to s. e. and 26
in width, although in some parts less. On its shores

==[[This lake is of sufficient depth for vessels of
any size]]==, since in many bays not far in from its
shores there are from four to six fathoms of water,
and within it, some places from 40 to 50. It is, as
far as is ascertained, without any shoals or banks.
Near it grow some herbs, called clacchos, eaten by
the cows and pigs ; also a great quantity of the
herb called totora, or cat’s tail, which in some
parts grows to the length of a yard and an half.
Of this the Indians make rafts, not only for fishing
but for carrying to and fro the cattleand productions
of the harvest and crops growing in the various
islands lying in this lake. Some of these islands
are so covered and hemmed in with the herb totora
that it requires much force and labour to cut a pas-
sage through it. In one of the largest of these
islands the Incas had a magnificent temple, dedi-
cated to the sun, the first that was ever built. This
lake is not without its tempests and squalls ; they
are, on the contrary, frequent, and have at times
caused no inconsiderable mischief. Its waters
are thick, but are nevertheless drank by the cattle,
and even the Indians ; particularly by those of
the nation of the Uros, who are a poor ignorant
people, who formerly lived upon the islands in
great wretchedness, and who by dint of great solici-
tations have been prevailed upon to leave them for
the mainland^ where they now reside in some mi-
serable caves, excavated places, or holes in the
earth covered over with fiags of totora^ maintain-

ing themselves by fishing. This lake contains
likewise various kinds of fish, such as trout,
ormantos, cuches, anchovies, and boquillas in
abundance; these are, for the most part, about
the length of a man’s hand, and three fingers
thick. The Indians of Yunguyo take upwards
of 700 yearly, and sell them at four and six dollars
the thousand. They also catch some small peje-
reyesy and an infinite variety of birds, which are
salted, and afford excellent food. It is confidently
and repeatedly asserted by the Indians, that the
greater part of the riches of the country was thrown
into this lake when the Spaniards entered it at the
time of the conquest ; and amongst other valuables
the great gold chain made by the order of the
Inca Huayanacap, which was 2S3 yards in length,
and within which 6000 men could dance.
