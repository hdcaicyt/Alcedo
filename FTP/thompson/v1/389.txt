==[[Chilca|CHILCA]]==, a settlement of the province and cor-
regimiento of Canete in [[Peru]], with a small but
safe and convenient port. It abounds in saltpetre,
which its natives carry to Lima for the purpose of
making gunpowder, on which account they are
for the most part muleteers or carriers. In its
vicinity are the remains of some magnificent build-
ings which belonged to the Incas of Peru. The
name of Chilca is given by the Indians of the same
kingdom, as also by those of the kingdom of [[Quito]],
to a small tree or shrub which is a native of hot
climates, and which, when burnt to ashes, is
often used as lye for the use of the sugar en-
gines.

==[[Chi Dc A|Chi DC A]]==, a beautiful and extensive valley of
this province, which, although it be not irrigated
by any river, stream, or fountain, by which it
might be fertilized, produces an abundant harvest of
maize. The seed of this is accustomed to be
buried in the ground with heads of pilchards, an
abundance of which fish is found upon the coast;
and thus, by the moisture arising from this prac-
tice, and by the morning dews, the soil becomes
suflaciently moistened to produce a very fair crop.
The same method is observed, and the same effect
produced, with regard to other fruits and herbs ;
but for drinking and culinary uses, the little

water that is procured is drawn from wells. Lat.

settlement of TIacolula, and alcaldia mayor of
Xalapa, in Nueva Espafla ; situate in a very ex-
tensive glen, surrounded by heights which begin
in the neighbourhood of Xilotepec, and run some-
what more than a league in length. The popula-
tion is very scanty, and the temperature bad ;
indeed, out of the many families which formerly
inhabited it, 19 only are remaining ; these employ
themselves in the rancherias^ agriculture being
indispensably necessary to their maintenance,
owing to the barrenness of the territory of the dis-
trict. At the distance of a league to the n. of Xa-
lapa, and on the side of the royal road leading to
^^exico, is the great mill of Lucas Martin. Here
the lands are fertilized by the large river Cerdeilo ;
by the waters of which also other settlements arc
supplied, as likewise some of ihe ranchos^ wherein
employment is found for upwards of SO families
of Spaniards, some Mustees^ and many Indians.
Four leagues to the s. w. of its head settlement.

situations are pointed out to tlie traveller by crosses
stuck up in the roads. Its population consists of
470 families of Tarascos Indians, and about 300 of
Spaniards, Mulattoes, and Mustees\ who are,
for the most part, scattered in the agricultural
estates of its district, where, from the fertility of the
soil, wheat, maize, and other seeds, are cultivated
in abundance. The country is agreeable, and well
stocked with every kind of fruit trees. The capi-
