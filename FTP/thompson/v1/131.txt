[==[[Baltimore County|BALTIMORE County]]==, in Maryland, lies be-
tween Patapsco and Gunpowder rivers, the former
dividing it from Ann Arundel county on the s. and
s, w. ; Gunpowder and Little Gunpowder separat-
ing it from Harford county on the e. and n. e. It
has Frederick county, on the w. and n. w. Penn-
sylvania on the n. and Cliesapeak bay on the e.
Besides the rivers which bound it, and their
branches, this county has Back and Middle rivers
between the two former, but they are rather arms
of Chesapeak bay than rivers. Back river, four or
five miles e. of Patapsco, receives two small
streams; the north-w'esternmost is called Herring
Run. Middle river has little or no supply^ of fresh
water. There are numerous iron works in this
county ; and it contains 25,434 inhabitants, includ-
ing 587 slaves. Ls chief town is Baltimore.]

[==[[Baltimoue]]==, the chief town in the above
county, is the largest in the state of [[Maryland]].

==[[In size it is the fourth]]==, and in commerce the fifth
in rank in the Lnited States. It is situated on the
n. side of Patapsco river, at a small distance from
its junction Avith the Chesapeak : the entrance of
the harbour is defended by Whetstone fort, hardly
a pistol-shot across, and of course may easily be
defended against naval force. From the head ol’
Elk river, at the head of the bay to -Baltimore, is
about 60 miles. The town is built around what is
called the basin, reckoned one of the finest har-
bours in America: tiie Avater rises five or six feet
at common tides : it is divided into Avhat is called
the Town and Fell’s point, by a creek, over which
are tAvo bridges, but the houses extend in an irre-
gular manner from the one to the other. At Fell’s
point the Avater is deep enough for ships of burden,
but small Amssels only go up to the town. The
situation is loAV, and Avas formerly thought un-
healthy ; but by its rapid increase, improvements
have taken place which have corrected the damp-
ness of the air, and it is now judged to be tole-
rably healthy. In 1787 it contained 1955 dwelling-
houses, of wiiich 1200 were in the town, and the
rest at Fell’s point. It then contained 1 52 store-
houses. The number of the inhabitants of the town
and precincts, in 1791,Avere 13,503, including 1255
slaves. The number of houses and inhabitants
have been greatly increased since. Before the
emigration of the French people from cape Fran-
cois, and other islands, the houses had increased to
2300. Those unfortunate people, flying from their
merciless countrymen, Avho had burned and pillag-
ed their cities and towns, and murdered their rela-
tions and friends, found here an hospitable asylum,
after suflTerings hardly paralleled in the annals of
history. Here are nine places of public Avorship,
which belong to Roman Catholics, German Calvi-
nists and Lutherans, Episcopalians, Presbyterians,
Baptists, Methodists, Quakers, and Nicolites, or
New Quakers, who all live together in peace. It
is inhabited by people from most parts of Europe.
The principal street is Market Street, Avhich runs
nearly e. and w. a mile in length, parallel Avith the
water : this is crossed by a number of other streets,
which run from the Avater, a number of which,
particularly Calvert and Gay streets, are Avell
built. N. and e. of the town the land rises, and
])rescnts a noble vieAV of the town and bay. In
1790, tijis city owned 27 ships, 1 snow, 31 bri-
gantines, 34 schooners, and 9 sloops, total 102;
tonnage 13,564. The exports in the same year
amounted to 2,027,770, and the imports to
1,949,899 dollars. The exports in duly, August,
and September, in 1790, amounted only to 343,584
