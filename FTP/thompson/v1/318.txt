but to meliorate their condition, they arrive with a
willingness to work, and a courage to undertake
any thing that they think the most proper to an-
swer their views. Their example even inspires a
sort oT emulation among the Creoles, productive
of public prosperity. Cattle forms the great mass
of the wealth of the inhabitants. Oxen, horses,
and mules, are very numerous. Agriculture, al-
though not much followed, is yet not neglected.
Indigo and coffee are almost the only things they
grow. The quality of the soil gives the fruits an
exquisite flavour, but particularly the oranges,
which are famed throughout the province. The
city is large, handsome, and well divided ; they
compute the inhabitants at 9300. The parish
church, by its construction and neatness, answers
to the industry and piety of the people. The heat
at San Carlos is extreme ; it would be excessive if
the n. wind did not moderate the effects of the sun.

24 s. s.e. of St. Valencia, and 20 from St. Philip’s.

[==[[Carlos]]==, San, ue Monterey, the capital of
iSew California, founded in 1770, at the foot of the
cordillera of Santa Lucia, which is covered with
oiiks, pines, (foliis lernis J, and rose bushes. The
village is two leagues distant from the presidio of
the same name. It appears that the bay of Mon-
terey had already been discovered by Cabrillo on
the 13th November 1542, and that he gave it the
name of Bahia rle los Pinos, on account of the
beautiful pines with which the neighbouring moun-
tains are covered. It received its present name
about 60 years afterwards from Viscaino, in ho-
nour of the viceroy of Mexico, Gaspar deZunega,
Count de Monterey, an active man, to whom we
are indebted for considerable maritime expedi-
tions, and who engaged Juan de Onate in the con-
quest of New Mexico. The coasts in the vicinity
of San Carlos produce the famous aurum merum
(ormier) of Monterey, in request by the inhabi-
tants of Nootka, and which is employed in the
trade of otter-skins. The population of San Carlos
is 700.]
