It extends across the peninsula, and is washed by

district called Marshpee or Mashpee, on the w. t
is about five miles broad and nine long ; 67 miles
s. e. from Boston. Sandy Neck, on the n. shore,
runs e. almost the length of the town, and forms
the harbour, embosoming a large body of salt
marsh. The harbour is about a mite wide and 4:
long, in which the tide rises from eight to fourteen
feet. It has a bar running off n. e. from the Neck
several miles, which prevents the entrance of large
ships, but small vessels may pass any part of it
at high water ; and where it is commonly crossed,
it seldom has less than six or seven feet at low
water. There is another harbour on the s. called
Lewis’s bay ; its entrance is within Barnstable, and
it extends almost two miles into Yarmouth. It is
commodious and safe, and is completely landlock-
ed, and has five feet water at a middling tide. A
mile or two to the w. and near the entrance of
Lewis’s bay, lies Hyanis road ; it is formed prin-
cipally by an island joined by a beach to Yarmouth,
which together make the outside of the bay before
mentioned. The s. head of this island is called
point Gammon. Oyster bay, near the s. w. limit'
of the town, admits small vessels, and which, with‘
Lewis’s bay, has in years past produced excellent
oysters in great quanlities,though they are now much
reduced. There are about 20 or 30 ponds in Barn-
stable. The land here produces about 25 bushels
of Indian corn to an acre, and rye and other grain-
in proportion. Wheat and flax are cultivated,
the latter with success. From 12 to 18,000 bushels
of onions are raised for the supply of the neigh-
bouring towns. Upwanis of 100 men are employ-
ed in the fishery, which is yearly increasing.
Whales seldom come into Massachusetts bay now^,
and that fishery is discontinued. No quarrels
with the ancient natives of the country are recorded
