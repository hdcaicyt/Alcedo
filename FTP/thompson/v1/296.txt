city of the province of [[Venezuela]], founded by
Diego Losada in the year 1566, in a beautiful and
extensive valley of more than four leagues in
length. It is of a very mild temperature, being
neither troubled with excessive heat or cold. It is
watered by four rivers, which fertilize its territory,
and make it abound as well in delicate waters as
in exquisite fruits and tiowers: the streets are wide
and straight, the buildings elegant and convenient,
and it is ornamented by four marts. It is the seat
of the bishopric, erected in the city of Coro in
1532, and translated to this spot in 1636. It has
a beautiful cathedral church, besides some parish
chapels, which are Nuestra Senora de Alta Gra-

seminary for the education of youth, with five ca-
thedrals ; four hermitages dedicated to San Mau-
ricio, Santa Rosalia de Palermo, La Divina Pas-

alcaldes to govern the province in the vacancy of
a governor^ and Philip V. permitted a commer-
cial company of Biscayans to be established, who
reaped considerable affluence, especially in the ar-
tiles of cacoa and sugar, the chief source of its re-
venues ; but this company was abolished in the
reign of Charles III. in the year 1778 ; which cir-
cumstance Avas considered by the city and the pro-

vince as a most considerable privilege. The num-
ber of inhabitants amounts to about iOOO, besides
an infinity of people of colour by whom it is in-
habited. The natives have shown themselves to^
