This creek is famous for a bloody battle, fought
Sept. 11, 1777, between the British and Ameri-
cans, which lasted nearly the whole day, and the
latter were defeated with considerable loss ; but it
was far from being of that decisive kind which

meeting between the hostile armies on nearly
equal terms, both as to numbers and the nature
of the ground on which each army was situated.
It was fought at Chadd’s ford, and in the neigh-
bourhood of, and on, the strong grounds at Bir-
mingham church. See Delaware, for an ac-
count of the celebrated mills on this creek.]
