==[[The antidote]]==, however, is oil taken in abundance
internally, and applied outwardly. Neither wheat
nor barley are known here, but the place abounds
in maize and rice, of which they make cakes, and
which are the common bread of the natives, and
more particularly so that called cazave^ being a
sort of cake made of the root yiica^ name, or mo-
niato. There are also a great number of cotton
trees. The arms of this city are a green cross
upon a gold ground, with a lion rampant on
each side. It was sacked in 1593 by Robert
Baal, a pirate ; in 1583, by Sir Francis Drake, 23
years from the time of its being fortified, and not
from its foundation, as according to Mr. La Ma-
tiniere ; again iti 1695, by Mr. Ducase, assisted by
the adventurers or fiibustiers, who completely pil-
laged it : but a great sensation having been caused
amongst the inhabitants at the loss of a superb se-
pulchre made of silver, in which it rvas usual on
a good Friday to deposit the eucharist, they had
the good fortune to obtain its restitution through
the interest and favour of Louis XI F. The
English, under the command of Admiral Vernon
and Sir Charles Ogle, besieged this city in 1740,
when, although its castles were destroyed, and
it was completely besieged, it would not surren-
der, being gloriously defended by the viceroy
Don Sebastian de Esiava, and Don Bias de Lezo,
who caused the English to abandon the enterprise
with precipitancy and with great loss. [For this
conduct on the part of the English, several reasons
were assigned besides the strength of the place ;
namely, the mortality among the troops, want
of skill in the commanders, and certain ditferences
between the admiral and the general. The forti-
fications which they demolished have since been
repaired.] It is the only part of all America where
there is etfective coin of a fourth part of a real in
silver. Its inhabitants amount to 9160 souls in
communion. It has been the native place of many
celebrated persons, such are,
