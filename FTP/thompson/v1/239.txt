' CAICO, Grande, or of the North, one of
the islands which lie to the n. of St. Domingo,
and the largest of them all. Its figure is long and
broad, extending itself in the form of a half-moon,
which figure is rendered perfect by many others.

==[[Caicos|CAICOS]]==, tlie name of a large cluster of islands
in the N, sea, situate on thew. of Hispaniola, or St.
Domingo. Between them and the island of [[Ma]]-
guana, or Mariguana, there is formed a channel,
called the Old Passage, which was navigated by
vessels leaving the })ort of the Havanna for Europe,
previous to the discovery of the Bahamas by An-
ton de Alaminos. This passage was abandoned
on account of the navigation through so many
small islands, which rendered it hazardous. It is
at present frequented solely by small smuggling
vessels. Notwithstanding this, it was entered by
the whole squadron and convoy of Admiral Sir
George Pocock, when he besieged and took the
Havanna, in the year 1763. [The Caicos islands,
commonly called the Caucuses, arc a cluster of
the Bahama islands, situate upon the edge of one of
the Bahama banks. On the n. side of tliis bank
are four or five islands of considerable extent ; the
largest (called the Grand Caicos) is sbovc sixty
miles long, and two or three broad. It is about
400 miles from New Providence, and due n. from
St. Domingo. There are several good reef-har-
bours and anchorages, particularly that at St.
George’s key, where there is established a port
of entry and a small battery. This harbour ad-
mits vessels drawing 14 feet water. Besides cot-
ton and other produce which is common to the
Bahama islands, some sugar plantations have
been attempted in the Caicos, but, owing probably
to the want of sufiicient rain in that climate, or
to the natural sterility of the soil, they have not
succeeded. In 1803 there were about 40 white
inhabitants upon the f aicos, and nearly 1200
slaves, but many of the latter have been since re-
moved. Previous to May 1803, lands were grant-
ed by the crown to the amount of 29,695 acres
for the purpose ol' cultivation See Bahamas.]

==[[Cailloma|CAILLOMA]]==, a settlement and asiento of silver
mines of the province of [[Collahuas]] in [[Peru]] ;
founded on account of the discovery of this mi-
neral in a nsountain at tAvo leagues distance. It is
one of the most ancient, and from it has been pro-
duced the greatest riches ; indeed, it has the pros-
pect of yielding these much longer, in as much
as there are supposed to be many veins ofthis me-
tal as yet undiscovered. The metals are wrought
in a mill worked by the Avater of a stream wliich
rises at four leagues distance; and m order that
there may never be a deficiency, the necessary sup-
ply of Avater is let upon the mills by means of locks,
from an adjacent lake called Villafro, about a
league in circumference. This is necessary only
in time of tlrenight, Avhich occurs in the months of
August, Septemlier, and October. The locks in
the rainy season are kept shut, in order that the
lake may fill, and be ready to yield its supply upon
occasion. This settlement contains tAvo parishes,
one of Spaniards, the other of Indians ; besides a
church, Avhich tliey call Del Hospital, since it
Avas sii])ported by the mines Avhen tliese were in a
flourishing state. The soil about the country is
very barren, and it can never produce herbage for
cattle, being situate betAveen tAvo mountains al-
together lacking moisture, and extremely cold. In
the church belonging to the Spaniards is reve-
renced a cross, of an opaque or ash-coloured
crystal, extremely perfect, and something ex-
ceeding the size of a palm, Avhich, with two
others (the one of Avhich, accortling to tradition,
Avas carried to Spain, and the other lost) Avere
loufid in a mine on the 2d of May, on the first
discovery and taking of the metal, at the depth of
40 fathom. They Avere discovered iii the form of
a calvary, this of Avhich Ave speak being the largest.
