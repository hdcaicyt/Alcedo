ordinary, on the second Tuesday in September,
November, January, March, and May. This
city consists of more than 40 houses, but has
not arrived at that pitch of grandeur that was
expected, on account of its planters and mer-
chants having been always at variance, as are
those of Virginia; and from this it is judged,
that it can never hope to rise at a greater elevation
of dignity or fortune. [It stands at the mouth of
the Severn, SO miles s. of Baltimore, 32 e. by n,
from the Federal city, 72 s. from Wilmington
in Delaware state, and 132 s. w, from Philadel-
phia, In 1694 it was made a port town. It is
situated on a peninsula formed by the river and
two small creeks, and affords a beautiful prospect
of Chesapeak bay, and the e. shore beyond it. This
city is of little note in the commercial world, but
is the wealtliiest town of its size in the United
States. The houses, about 300 in number, are
spacious and elegant, indicative of great wealth.
The state house is the noblest building of the kind,
in the Union. It stands in the centre of the city,
from which point the streets diverge in every
direction like radii. Lat. 39° 2' «. Long. 76°
