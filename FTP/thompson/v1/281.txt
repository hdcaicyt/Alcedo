==[[Imports]]==, 1810. — ^Amongthe articles included un-
der this head, we observe the increasing importations
direct from Spain and Portugal, and other parts of
Europe south of cape Finisterre to Canada. We
trust this new branch of the British North Ame-
rican trade will soon be put under such judicious
regulations as will give the colonies the benefit in-
tended by the legislature in this deviation from the
colonial system. We are, however, sorry to ob-
serve, that every facility which might be afforded
to the export trade of Canada has not yet been
granted. We understand a committee has been
appointed by congress, to ascertain whether the
produce of the countries on the borders of rivers
and lakes which have their outlet to the sea by
the river St. Lawrence, and which are extremely
fertile, can be brought down any of the rivers with-
in the United States to their Atlantic ports, for
shipment in American vessels.

Shipping. — The number of ships, principally
belonging to the leading out- ports in Great Britain,
which have entered into the Quebec trade, exceeds
the most sanguine expectations which were formed
by persons well and long acquainted with the re-

sources of that province ; and the ships which have
been engaged in the trade to Nova Scotia and New
Brunswick, and their dependencies, have increased
in nearly the same proportion. It may be remark-
ed, that in the furtherance of this trade, no specie
is sent out of the country, the returns being nearly
all made in British produce and manufactures, a)id
the difference either left here with the correspond-
ents of the colonists, or invested in the j)ublic
funds. The employment which is thus afforded to
British ships and British seamen, and the advan-
tages which must result to the traders and manu-
facturers of the country, and to the various useful
classes connected with ship-building, from such
employment of our own shipping, cannot fail to
excite astonisment in the minds of the most indif-
ferent and inattentive observers, that these colo-
nies should have been so long considered posses-
sions of little value or importance, and that we at
last resorted to them from necessity. Indeed, wc
have to thank the northern powers of Europe,
and the government of the United States, for ha-
ving opened our eyes, and directed our attention to
these invaluable appendages of the British empire.

and pearl ashes, and provisions of every descrip-

Canada, and were shipped off to Europe, or the
West Indies. The Canadian merchants rejoiced at
the embargo, which enriched them while it made
their neighbours poor indeed. The arrival of Sir
James Craig diffused new life and activity through
the province ; the imbecility and irresolution
which before characterised the government, in-
stantly vanished ; large sums of money were cir-
culated by the troops, and the construction of new
works, with the repairs of the old, gave full em-
ployment to the labouring part of the community ;
the price of provisions became proportionately en-
hanced, chiefly at Quebec, v/here an unusual num-
ber of seamen and soldiers had taken up their resi-
dence ; hence the country people were enriched,
and encouraged to greater exertions. The price of
every thing has been nearly trebled within the last
60 years ; but the colony has risen into import-
ance : agriculture and commerce continue to ini-]
