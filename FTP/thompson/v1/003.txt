==[[Abipones|ABIPONES]]==, a nation of barbarous Indians, of
the province and government of [[Tucuman]], in-
habiting the s. shores of the river Berraejo. Their
number once exceeded 100,000 ; but they are cer-
tainly at present much reduced. They go naked,
except that the women cover themselves with little'
skins, prettily ornamented, which they call quey-
api. They are very good swimmers, of a lofty
and robust stature, and well featured : but they
paint their faces and the rest of their body, and are
very much given to Avar, which they carry on
chiefly against such as come either to hunt or to
fish upon their territory. Their victims they have
a custom of sticking upon lofty poles, as a land-
mark, or by way of intimidation to their enemies.
From their infancy they cut and scarify their
bodies, to make themselves hardy. When their
country is inundated, which happens in the five
winter months, they retire to live in the islands, or
upon the tops of trees : they have some slight no-
tion of agriculture, but they live by fishing, and
the produce of the chase, holding in the highest
estimation the flesh of tigers, which they divide
among their relations, as a sort of precious relic or
dainty ; also asserting that it has the properties of
infusing strength and valour. They have no know-
ledge either of God, of law, or of policy ; bat they
believe in the immortality of the soul, and that
there is a land of consummate bliss, where they
shall dance and divert themselves after their death.
When a man dies, his Avidow observes a state of
celibacy, and fasts a year, which consists in an ab-
stinence from fish ; this period being fulfilled, an
assembly run out to meet her, and inform her that
her husband has given her leave to marry. The
Avomen occupy themselves in spinning and sevi'ing
hides ; the men are idlers, and the boys run about
thcAvholeday in exercisingtheirstrength. The men
are much addicted to drunkenness, and then the
women are accustomed to conceal their husband’s
Aveapons, for fear of being killed. They do not rear
more than tivo or three children, killing all above
this number.
