[==[[British America|BRITISH America]]==. Under the general
name of British America, we comprehend the vast
extent of country, bounded s. by the United States
of America and the Atlantic ocean; e. by the
same ocean and Davis’s straits, which divide it
from Greenland; extending n. to the «. limits
of Hudson bay charter, and to. indefinitely ;
lying between lat. 42° SO' and 70° w. ; and long. 50°
and 96° from Greenwich. British America is
divided into four provinces, viz. 1. Upper Ca-
nada ; 2. Lower Canada, to which are annexed
New' Britain, or the country lying round Hudson
bay, and the island of [[Cape]] Breton, which island,
in 1784, Avas formed into a separate government,
by the name of Sydney; 3. Ne^v Brunswick;
4. Nova Scotia, to which is annexed the island of
St. John’s. Besides these, there is the island of
Newfoundland, which is governed by the admiral
for the time being, and two lieutenant-governors,
who reside at Placentia and St. John’s. The troops
stationed at Newfoundland, however, are subject to
tlie orders of the governor-general of the four
British provinces. The number of people in the
whole of the n. British colonies, is estimated
by Morse at about 160,000 or 180,000 ; but has,
from the time he Avrote, most rapidly increased.
Since the four provinces have been put under a
general governor, the governor of each is styled
lieutenant-governor. The residence of the general
governor is at Quebec. The following informa-
- mation, from Edwards’s History of the West In-
dies, respecting the trade and resources of British
America, is insei ted under tliis head. The river
St. Lawrence remains usually locked up one half
of the year ; and although, in 1784, it was con-
fidently said, that the British provinces Avould be
able in three years to supply all the West Indies
with lumber and provisions, yet it Avas found ne-
cessary to import lumber and provisions into Nova
Scotia from the United States. Thus, in 1790,
there Avere shipped from the United States to
Nova Scotia alone, 540,000 staves and heading,
924,980 feet of boards, 285,000 shingles, and

16.000 hoops, 40,000 bbls. of bread and iiour, and

80.000 bushels of grain.

rage of four years ending Avith 1786. The only
provisions exported to Jamaica from Canada,
Nova Scotia, and St. John’s, betAveen Sd of April
1783, and 26th of October 1784, Avere 180 bushels
of potatoes, and 751 hhds. and about 500 bbls. of
salted fish. Of lumber, the quantity Avas 510,088
feet, 20 bundles of hoops, and 301,324 shingles ;
and on an average of five years, from 1768 to
1772, the whole exports to Jamaica from Canada,
Nova Scotia, and St. John’s, were only S3 bbls. of
flour, 7 hhds. of fish, 8 bbls. of oil, 3 bbls. of tar,
pitch, and turpentine, 36,000 shingles and staves,
and 27,235 feet of lumber. From the custom-house
returns it appears, that of 1208 cargoes of lumber
and provisions imported from North America to the
British sugar-colonies in 1772, only seven of those
cargoes were from Canada and Nova Scotia ; and
that of 701 top-sail vessels, and 1681 sloops, Avhich
had cleared outwards from North Am.erica to the Bri-
tish and foreign West Indies, only two of the top-
sail vessels, and 11 of the sloops, Avere from these
provinces; and it has been proved, that in the
years 1779, 1780, 1781, and 1782, the scarcity in
Canada had been such as to occasion the export of
all bread, Avheat, and flour, to be prohibited by
authority ; and in 1784, Avhen a parliamentary
inquiry took place concerning Avhat supplies the
West Indies might expect from Canada and Nova
Scotia, a ship in the river Thames Avas actually
loading with flour for Quebec.]
