Rear-Admiral Don Joseph de Iturriaga, for which
purpose he assembled together some wandering
people of the provinces of Caracas and Barcelona.
At present, however, it is as it were desert and
abandoned, since its inhabitants have returned to
their former savage state of life, having been con-
stantly pursued and harassed by the Charibes
Indians, against whom they could no longer main-
tain their ground, after that the king’s garrison
had been withdrawn, and since, owing to the dis-
tance at which they were situate from the capital,
it was in vain for them to look for any succour
from that quarter.

racaibo, on thew. side.

the mountains of Dorado or Manoa to the n.w.
The whole of its territory is, as it were, unknown.
The Portuguese possess the shores of the Maranon
and the sea-coast as far as the bay of Vicente Pin-
zon ; the Dutch of the colony of [[Surinam]], by the
river Esequevo or Esquivo, called also Rupununi,
have penetrated as far as the Maranon, by the river
Paranapitinga. The mountains, which some have
represented as being full of gold, silver, and pre-
cious stones, sparkling in the rays of the sun, are
merely fables, which, at the beginning of the con-
quests, deceived many who had gone in search of
these rich treasures, and fell a sacrifice to the
fatigues and labours which they experienced in
these dry and mountainous countries. The Por-
tuguese have constructed here two forts, called Paru
and Macapa. Mr. De la Martiniere, with his
usual want of accuracy, says that the Portuguese
have a settlement called Coropa, at the mouth of
the river Coropatuba, where it enters the Maranon ;
the Coropatuba joins the Maranon on the n. side,
in the country of Coropa, and at the settlement of
this name ; this settlement being nothing more than
a small fort, and lying in the province of [[Topayos]],
on the s. shore of the Maranon, and being known
by the name ofCurupa, in the chart published in
1744, and in that of the Father Juan Magnin, in
1749.
