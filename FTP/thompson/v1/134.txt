==[[Barbacoas|BARBACOAS]]==, a city of the province and go-
vernment of Esrneraldas in the kingdom of [[Quito]],
situate between the rivers Pati and Guaxi, near
the coast of the S. sea, is also called Nuestra Se-
nora del Puerto del Nuevo Toledo. Its soil is
warm and moist, and the houses, although built of
wood and a certain cane called guadua, and cover-
ed in with large dried leaves instead of tiles, are
nevertheless very commodious and of a decent
construction. Its inhabitants are docile, amiable,
and courteous, and of singular genius. It has
many families of distinction, who possess gold
mines which are worked by the Negro slaves.
The gold is of the best quality, and is carried to
be coined at the mint of Popayan. Victuals and
clothing are very dear, since they are brought
from Pasto, Popayan, the town of Ibarra, and
from Quito : it is governed by a vice-governor and
two alcaldes, who are elected yearly. Here is an
official real and a commissary of the inquisition ;
and with regard to its ecclesiastical concerns, it is
governed by a vicar belonging to the bishopric
of Quito. The first person who found his way
amongst these mountains, for the sake of convert-
ing the nation of Barbacoas, of whom but few are
now remaining, was Fatlier Lucas de la Cueva,
of the abolished company of the Jesuits, in 1640.
It has four dependent settlements, and lies between
the river Huachi to the w. and the Telembi to the
n. e. in Lat. 1° 42' s. Long. 78° 8' w.

and that of Samana, is very large and capacious.

==[[Barbacoas]]==, another settlement of the province
and government of [[Venezuela]], on the shore of the
lake of Maracaibo.

==[[Barbadoes|BARBADOES]]==, an island of the N. sea, one of
the Lesser Antillas, situate to the n. of that of St.
Vincent, and to the s. of Martinica ; is eight
leagues long and five wide, and is of an oval
shape. It was discovered by William Courteen
in 1625, in the reign of James 1. king of England,
who was returning from Pernambuco in [[Brasil|Brazil]],

and was driven hither by a tempest, when he
went on shore to reconnoitre, and found the island
was crowded with wood ; indeed it was supposed
that there was not a clear spot of ground upon it,
and it seemed altogether desert, and uninhabited
even by savages. There were neither pastures,
grain, or herbs to be found upon it; but as the
climate was good, and the soil appeared to be fer-
tile, it was settled by some English of small for-
tunes, who, after infinite pains and difficulty, :suc-
ceeded in clearing away some of the timber with
wliich it was so covered : the first crops were of
course but scanty, but this, however, did not
cause these new colonists to give up their enter-
prise ; and they were afterwards kept in counte-
nance and joined by some of their brethren who
fled hither on account of the English civil wars.
It was then granted by the king as a property to
his favourite the Earl of Carlisle, and it thus
so far increased in population, that in 20 years
afterwards, namely in 1650, it contained 50,000
whites, and a greater number of Negro slaves.
The king created 13 barons in this colony, who,
in 1676, had upwards of 1000 Negroes, and;em-
ployed more than 400 vessels, from 50 to 100 tons
burthen, in their commerce of sugar, indigo, cot-
ton, ginger, and other productions. The in-
crease of the English colonies in the other islands
caused the extraordinary elevation of fortune and
dignity then prevalent in this, in some degree, to
subside ; and what did not in a less degree con-
tribute to its downfal, was the terrible plague
which broke out here in 1692, and continued for
some years. It is by nature very strong, and
completely surrounded by rocks, so that it is
thoroughly sheltered to the windw'ard ; to the
leeward it has many good bays, and the whole
coast is defended by a line of small forts. The
country has the most beautiful appearance, being
a series of valleys and mountains, cultivated in all
parts, and full of plantations of sugar-cane,
oranges, lemons, citrons, limes, guavas, papas,
aloes, and many other kinds of delicious fruits,
and interspersed with country villas and dAvell-
ings : one of the principal branches of its com-
merce is rum, which is esteemed of the finest qua-
lity ; it abounds in fish and birds, ajid has many
great caves or caverns, some of which are large
enough to contain 500 men, and are used as hid-
ing places by the Negroes who run away from
their masters. Its temperature is very hot, espe-
cially in the eight summer months, and the heat
would indeed be intolerable, were it not for the
n. e. breeze which springs up about sun-rise, and
lasts as long as this luminary is above the horizon.
