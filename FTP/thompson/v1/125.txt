[fresh water; it is found however by digging
wells in the rocks, to the depth of the sea level,
and also very often by making holes in the sand
along the coasts, a few feet from the surface. In
several of the islands are small natural fresh-water
ponds, produced by the rain collected from the
rocks ; but there is not supposed to exist, through-
out the Bahamas, a single spring of fresh water
or rividet.

==[[General History|General History]]==. — One of the Bahama islands
(the ancient Indian name of which is stated to be
Guanahani) has been generally fixed upon by
historians and geographers as the spot where the
first discovery of the new world took place, by
Columbus, upon the 11th of October 1492. The
island was named by him St. Salvador, by
which appellation, as also that of Cat island, it
is now generally known. There appears, how-
ever, to exist some doubt with respect to the point
of land first actually discovered by Columbus in
the new world. The accounts of his first voyage
to America generally state that his squadron kept
almost a due w. course from the Canary islands
(the last land from which he took his departure)
across the Atlantic ; and that, for two or three
days before land was discovered, he found himself
in soundings. It is also stated that he landed at
a secure and spacious harbour, and that the
island (St. Salvador) had verdant fields, watered
with many rivulets. If these accounts were true,
and if the island now known by that name was ac-
tually the land first discovered by Columbus, it
may be concluded that some great change or con-
vulsion must have taken place in that quarter of
the world since its discovery. At present there
are no soundings to the e. of St. Salvador ; and
along the whole of the e. coast of that island, is a
reef which would prevent any landing on that
side. There is no harbour but a small one round
the^. end of the island, facing the s. w. in one of
the shallow Bahama banks. No verdant fields can
now be found upon the island of [[St]]. Salvador,
which is barren and rocky, like the rest of tlie
Bahama islands ; throughout the whole of which,
as was before observed, no rivulet of any descrip-
tion has been discovered. There can be no doubt,
however, that one of the Bahama islands was the
first land discovered by Columbus. The island of
Abaco is situated nearer the latitudeof the Canaries,
and there is a good harbour on the e. side of that
island ; but there are no soundings at any distance
from the shore on that side. It is perhaps more
likely that Abaco (or one of the otJier most n. of
the Bahama islands) was the first point of disco-
very, particularly if it be true what is stated, that

a few days after he discovered land he touched at
New Providence and Andros island (which it is
said he named Fernandina and Isabella) in his
way to Cuba ; and it is extremely improbable that
he would touch at those islands in his way to
Cuba from St. Salvador.

==[[The Bahama Islands|The Bahama islands]]==, when discovered by Co-
lumbus, are stated to have been inhabited by a
numerous race of Indians, of a mild and peace-
able disposition, indolent in their habits, and little,
if at all, accustomed to the cultivation of Ihe soil.
They are described as being of a dark and dingy
hue, with long black hair, and with (heir bodies
painted with different colours. Many thousands
of these unfortunate people are stated to have been
carried over by the Spaniards, in their subsequent
settlements, and compelled to work in the mines of
S. America. The early accounts of the Bahama
islands, after their discovery, are, however, ex-
tremely obscure. There appears scarcely any
trace of the original Indian inhabitants. The ear-
liest settlement of Europeans which took place in the
Bahama islands, was under a patent of Charles
II. (1668), which granted those islands to certain
proprietary lords. Shortly after thatperiod, some at-
tempts appear to have been made to cultivate several
of the islands ; but, about the beginning of the last
century, they were again without inhabitants.
Some time afterwards, however, they became the
resort of numerous pirates, Bucaniers, and free-
booters ; the situation of these islands, from the
difficulties of the navigation, and their being near
the passages through which the valuable vessels
returned to Europe, being well-adapted for plun-
der and concealment. Among these pirates was
the noted Captain Teach, known by the name of
Blachbeard, who had the supreme command over
them, and of whom, as well as of Captain Vane,
and others who resorted to the Bahamas, a curi-
ous account may be found in Johnson’s Lives of
the Pirates, and in the History of the Bucaniers
of America.

==[[For the purpose of protecting the trade]]==, and
destroying these nests of free-booters. Captain
Woods Rogers was sent out from England as go-
vernor to the Bahamas, in the year 1718, and the
seat of government was fixed at New Providence,
upon which island Fort Nassau was built. From
that period, a regular colonial administration ap-
pears to have taken place ; but for a considerable
time, little cultivation or improvement seems to
have occurred at the Bahamas.
