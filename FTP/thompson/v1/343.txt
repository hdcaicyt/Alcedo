==[[Caxamarca|CAXAMARCA]]==, a province and corregimiento
of [[Peru]], in the bishopric of Truxillo ; bounded
s. e. by the province of [[Caxamarquilla]], e. by that
of Chachapoyas, n.w. by that of Luya and Chil-
Igos : all these three being situate at that part of
t^e Maranon which serves as a limit to this pro-
vince of Caxamarca. It is bounded ». by the pro-
vince of Jaen, n. w. by that of Piura, w. by that
of Saha and by a part of Truxillo, and s. by that
of Huamachuco. It is in length 40 leagues from
s. e. ion. w. ; and in breadth, or across, 36 leagues.
To enter it through the province of Truxillo, which
is the grand road, it is necessary to pass the cordil-
lera, which is not here so lofty as in the s. pro-
vinces. This province, however, abounds with
eminences which are branches of the cordillera;
and on account of the height and situation of
these, a great variety of temperature is experienced,
some parts being subject to an intense heat, and
others to , a severe cold. Thus it partakes of the
nature of the sierra, and its uneven figure no less
corresponds with it : but it is for the most part of a
good temperature, particularly in the capital. The
province abounds greatly in all kinds of fruits and
cattle : in it are fabricated cloths, baizes, blankets,
canvas for sails of ships, and cotton garments of a
Very fine and excellent quality. Formerly its prin-
cipal commerce was in swine ; at present it is not,
though these animals still abound in some parts.
It is watered by many rivers, of which those rising
on the w. side of the cordillera, as the Sana, Lam-
bay eque, and those passing through the province
of Truxillo, all enter the S. sea. The others,
amongst which that of the Criznejas is the largest,
incoporate themselves with the Maranon. On its
shores are lavaderos, or washing-places of gold;
and its rivers in general abound in very good and
wholesome fish. Besides the fruits and the pro-
ductions of every kind found in this province, it
has to boast many gold and silver mines, some of
which are worked. There a e also some of copper,

very fine lead, brimstone, and alcaparrosa. To-
wards the n. part, where it touches the province of
Jaen, are found some bark-trees, the production of
which, although not equal to the trees of Loxa, is
of the colour of heated copper, and possesses all
the virtues of the common bark. Here are also
many medicinal herbs, and amongst them the cele-
brated calagimla. In the time of the Indians, and
before the conquest, it was so well peopled that its
natives formed upwards of 500 settlements. At
present they amount to 46,000, being divided into
46 settlements. The capital bears the same title,
and the repartimiento of the corregidor used to
amount to 80,000 dollars, and it paid an alcavala
of 640 dollars per annum.
