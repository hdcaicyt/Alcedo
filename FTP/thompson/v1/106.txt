==[[Atacama|ATACAMA]]==, a province and corregimiento of
[[Peru]], bounded n. by the province of [[Arica]] ; n. e.
by Lipes ; e. and s. e. by the territoryj Salta
and jurisdiction of Tucuman ; s. where there is an
unpeopled waste as far as Copiapo, by the king-
dom of Chile ; and w. by the S. sea. It is divided
into High and Low. The first is of a cold tempera-
ture, abounding in fruits of the sierra^ in seeds
and potatoes. In the cordillera are numeious flocks
of ostriches and nicuhasy which the Indians hunt,
selling their skins and eating their flesh, which is
tender and well- tasted. The bezoar-stone is also
found here. Although the aforesaid animals are
extremely nimble, they are nevertheless hunted
with great ease ; and it is performed in this as well
a,s in other provinces by simply fixing upright, by
means of stones, some small sticks of about two
yards long, in a narrow pass ; and attaching to
each a thread or cord, they tie at small distances
pieces of coloured wool, which is moved about by
the wind. The trap being thus prepared, the
hunters endeavour to frighten the vicunas from
different parts into this valley, where, as soon as
they arrive, being completely overcome with
terror at the bits of wool, the whole of the troop
remain prisoners, this trifling barrier forming an
insurmountable obstacle to their escape. The
hunters then make use of a cord, somewhat more
than a yard long, having a stone attached to the
extremity, which they sling round the feet of the
vicunas y which being thus fast entangled, are ea-
sily taken. If, by accident, an huanaco is found
amongst the troop, the whole are lost, for he im-
mediately darts through the barrier, and the rest
follow him. This province is not without its gold
and silver mines ; but they are not regularly work-
ed. It has many springs of warm water, and a
lake called Blanca, abounding in salt, another
called Agul, a league and an half long, which is
as salt as the sea. The low province contains some
ports on its coast, where some go to fish for con-
gers, to sell in the sierra. In the mountain named
Conche, of the parish of Santa Barbara, and in
other parts, are mines of copper, which they
work and form into hammers, to be carried to Po-
tosi, or other parts where minerals are worked.
Here are found veins of crystal of various colours,
of jasper, talc, and copper, blue vitriol, and
alum. This province is much in want of water.
The most considerable river is that which runs
down into the sea through the valley of Loa,
serving there as a limit to this province and to
that of Arica. Its inhabitants amount only to
2500. The capital is the settlement of S. Fran-
