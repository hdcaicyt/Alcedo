The island of Abaco is at present uninhabited.
In 1788 it contained about 50 settlers and 200
Negroes. The lands granted by the crown, pre-
vious to May 1803, amounted to 14,058 acres, for
the purpose of cultivation ; but the settlers who
occupied it have since removed. It contains great
quantities of the various kinds of woods which
are common to almost all the Bahama islands.

To the northward of Abaco, is a long chain of
small islands or keys, (including Elbow Key,
Man of War Key, Great Guana Key, the Gala-
pagos, &c. &c.) reaching, in a n. w. direction,
almost to the Matanilla reefs on the Florida
stream ; from whence the Little Bahama bank ex-
tends, in a southerly direction, to the west point
of the island of the Grand Bahama. [Lat. 2C°
