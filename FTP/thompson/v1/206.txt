==[[[[Brasil|Brazil]]|BRAZIL]]==.

\Lichihart . — Orders were now dispatched to Admi-
ral Lichthart to attack the Portuguese ships where-
ever he could find them, and in consequence of
these orders he had soon an opportunity of ex-
hibiting a fresh proof of his skill and courage ; for
with four ships, a frigate, and a bark, he attacked
a Portuguese fleet of 17 sail, captured three of the
largest ships, together with the admiral, burnt and
sunk most of the rest, and killed 700 men. On
the news of this victory, the hopes of the council
began to revive, Avhen they received information
that Hoogstrate had yielded up the post of St. Au-
gustine. This officer, with the price of his trea-
chery, raised a regiment of 650 [[Brasil|Brazil]]ians, of
whom he was made colonel by the Portuguese,
and appearing at their head against his country-
men, behaved with great resolution and fidelity in
the service of his ncAv masters. In a short time
the Portuguese, OAving to the great superiority of
their force, made themselves masters of all the
strong places in Pernambuco, and at length
blocked up the Receiffe, the only remaining strong-
hold of the Dutch.

5. 0pm rupture between Holland and Portugal.
— As soon as the news of these transactions reached
Holland, the Portuguese ambassador endeavoured
to allay the irritation they had produced, by re-
presenting that his most faithful Majesty had no
concern in them whateA^er. Notwithstanding these
representations, hoAvever, the Dutch government
fitted out a fleet of 52 men of Avar, under the com-
mand of Admiral Blanker!, whom they nominated
admiral of [[Brasil|Brazil]], Guinea, and Angola. He was
accompanied on this expedition by Colonels
Shuppen and Henderson, who had acquired much
celebrity in the service of Count Maurice ; and
thus an open rupture commenced betAveen Hol-
land and Portugal.

==[[The Delays And Disasters Encountered By This
Fleet On Its Passage Avere So Great|The delays and disasters encountered by this

arrive at the Receiffe, till the garrison, reduced to
the utmost extremity, was on the point of sur-
rendering. The reinforcements, however, brought
by this fleet, enabled the Dutch to protract the
war a short time longer, and even to obtain a feAV
trifling advantages. But at the commencement
of 1647 the Portuguese again blocked up the
Receiffe, where the Avhole Dutch forces, amounting
to only 1800 men, were concentrated. This hand-
ful of troops made a gallant defence, but at length
sallying out to attack the enemy in the open field,
they were overpowered by numbers, and defeated
with the loss of 1100 men, most of their officers,
and all their artillery and amunition.

period became so rapid as to threaten the fota!
ruin of tlw? Dutch affairs in that part of the world ;
but these misfortunes, instead of stimulating them
to greater exertions, produced a national despon-
dency that tended to accelerate the destruction
which was become inevitable. The province of
Zealand recalled Admiral Blanker!, avIio was ac-
companied on his return by most of the officers
who had served under him ; but similar hardships
to those they had experienced in the passage out
befel them on their return ; so that tlie admiraf,.
as Avell as several of his officers, died before the
fleet arrived in Holland.

6. Expedition of Admiral Witte Wittezen . —
Sieur Shuk, an agent from the governors of Bra--
zil, Avho came over at the same timCy drew such
an affecting picture of affairs in that country, as
induced the States to resolve to make a vigorous
effort for the preservation of so valuable a settle-
ment. With this view they issued orders for fit-
ting out a fleet of 50 large men of war, and for
the embarkation of 6000 troops. The command
of this expedition was given to Admiral Witte
Wittezen, who Avas esteemed one of the ablest
officers in the Dutch service and it Avas also re-
solved to send after him an additional supply of
5 or 6000 more troops. The admiral sailed to-
wards the end of the year 1650; and after en-
countering very stormy weather on the passage,
he at length arrived on the coast of [[Pernambuco]] ;
but instead of a colony he found only an hospital
of sick, maimed, and infirm ; and in place of the
fortresses he was sent to succour, church-yards
filled with the bodies of those brave men who had
preceded him, and found their graves in the new
world.

==[[Such being the posture of affairs]]==, the admiral
resolved, notAvithstanding his orders, to return
home Avithout delay ; and this resolution he put
immediately into practice, leaving the colony in
a worse situation, if possible, than he found it ;
for which conduct he was called to account by the
States General, though he found means to justify
himself to their satisfaction. In short, ill-fortune
still continued to pursue the Dutch ; anrl towards
the conclusion of the year 1653, the Portuguese
government, who nOAV avowedly assisted Viera,
sent a fleet of 16 large men of Avar to attack the
Receiffe by sea, which so dismayed the garrison,
that they absolutely refused to fight ; and in the
following year the few remaining republicans who
had escaped famine and the sword evacuated Bra-
zil, in consequence of a capitulation signed the
28th of .January 1654.
