of the cometidador mayor of [[Alca]].ntara, Nicolas
de Obando, 16 leagues to the n. of the capital, St.
Domingo, on the skirt of some mountains which
are 12 leagues in height, and at the distance of
two leagues from the river Yauna. It is a small
and poor town. Its commerce depends upon the
salting of meats, and in preparing tallow and hides
to carry to St. Domingo, and in the chase of wild
goats, which are sold to the French. In its moun-
tains is a copper mine, two leagues to the s. e. of
the town. The Bucaniers, a French people of the
island of [[Tortuga]], commanded by Mr. Pouancy,
their governor, took and sacked it in 1676. [In

1505, the gold mines were worked here. The
copper mine above alluded to is in the mountain of
Meymon, whence comes the river of the same
name, and is so rich, that the metal, when refined,
will produce eight per cent, of gold. Here are also
found excellent lapis lazuli, a streaked chalk, that
some painters prefer to bole for gilding, load-
stone, emeralds, and iron. The iron is of the best
quality, and might be conveyed from the chain of
Sevico by means of the river Yuna. The soil
here is excellent, and the plantains produced here
are of such superior quality, that this manna of the

Point, and is a short turn in the river Mississippi,
about 35 miles above Mantchac fort, at the gut of
Ibberville, and 259 from the mouth of the river.
Charlevoix relates that the river formerly made a
great turn here, and some Canadians, by deepen-
ing the channel of a small brook, diverted the
waters of the river into if, in the year 1722. The
impetuosity of the stream was such, and the soil
of so rich and loose a quality, that in a short time
the point was entirely cut through, and the old
channel left dry, except in inundations ; by which
travellers save 14 feagues of their voyage. The
new channel has been sounded Avith a line of SO
fathoms, without finding bottom. The Spanish
settlements of Point Coupee extend 20 miles on the
w. side of the Mississippi, and there are some plan-
tations back on the side of La Fause Riviere,
through Avhich the Mississippi passed about 70
years ago. The fort at Point Coupee is a square
