==[[Next To Spain|Next to Spain]]==, the most considerable proprietor
of America was Great Britain, who derived her
claim to N. America from the first discovery of
that continent by Sebastian Cabot, in the name of
Henry VII. of England, in the year 1497, about
six years after the discovery of S. America by Co-
lumbus, in the name of the king of Spain. The
country was in general called Newfoundland, a
name which is now appropriated solely to an island
on its coast. It was a long time before the English
made any attempt to settle in this country. Sir
Walter Raleigh, an uncommon genins and a brave
commander, first shewed the way, by planting a
colony in the s. part, which he called Virginia, in
honour of queen Elizabeth, who was unmarried.

==[[The French|The French]]==, indeed, from this period until the
conclusion of the war of 1756, laid a claim to, and
actually possessed Canada and Louisiana ; but in
that war, they were not only driven from Cana-
da and its dependencies, but obliged to relinquish
all that part of Louisiana lying on the e. side of
the Mississippi ; and the British colonies, at the
peace of 1763, extended so far as to render it dif-
ficult to ascertain the precise bounds of the empire
of Great Britain in N. America. To the n. Bri-
tain might have extended her claims quite to the
pole. From that extremity, she had a territory ex-
tending s. to Cape Florida in the Gulph of Mexi-
co, in n. lat. 25°, and consequently near 4000
miles in a direct line ; and to the w. the bounda-
ries were unknown : but having entered into dis-
putes with her colonies, she brought on a war, of
which she felt the ruinous effects, by the dismem-
berment of her empire in N. America ; and Bri-
tish America, at the peace in 1783, was circum-
scribed within the narrow limits already men-
tioned.]
