either in the service of the United States during
the war, or fled to them for protection. The in-
digence or ill habits of these people occasioned the
breaking up of the settlement, and a better sort of
inhabitants have now taken their place. The lands
are fertile, and two rivers run through it, well
stored with fish. It has 575 inhabitants, and three
slaves. By the state census of 1796, 76 of the in-
habitants are electors.]}

==[[Cii Am Pii Ai N|CiiAMPiiAiN]]==, a lake of the same province, of
more than ^0 leagues in length, and from 10 to
12 in width, abounding in excellent fish. It was
discovered in 1609 by a French gentleman of tlie
name of Champlain, who gave it his name, which
it still retains. It communicates with a smaller
lake called Sacrament, and the canal passing from
one side to the other of these is extremely rapidand
dangerous, from the inequality of its bottom. At
the distance of 25 leagues to the s, are some very
lofty mountains, which are covered with snow, and
in which are found castors and a variety 'of ani-
mals of the chase; and between these mountains
and the aforesaid lake are some beautiful level
meadows or llanuras^ which, when first discover-
ed, were well peopled with Iroquees Indians ; but
these have greatly diminished in numbers, through
the continual wars Avith the French and English.
[This lake is next in size to lake Ontario, and lies
e. n. €. from it, forming a part of the dividing line
between the states of New York and Vermont. It
took its name from a French governor, who was
drowned in it; it was before called Corlaer’s lake.
Reckoning its length from Fairhaven to St.John’s,
a course nearly n. it is about 200 miles ; its breadth
is from one to 18 miles, being very different in diffe-
rent places ; the mean width is about five miles, and
it occupies about 500,000 acres ; its depth is suf-
ficient for the largest vessels. There are in it above
sixty islands of different sizes : the most consider-
able are North and South Hero and Motte island.
North Hero, or Grand isle, is 24 miles long, and
from two to four wide. It receives at Ticonderoga
the waters of lake George from the s. s. w. which
is said to be 100 feet higher than the waters of this
lake. Half the rivers and streams which rise in
Vermont fall into it. There are several which come
to it from New York state, and some from Cana-
da ; to which last it sends its own waters a n.
course, through Sorell or Chamblee river, into the
St. Lawrence. This lake is well stored with fish,
particularly salmon, salmon trout, sturgeon, and
pickerel, and the land on its borders, and on the
banks of its rivers, is good. The rocks in several
places appear to be marked and stained with the
former surface of the lake, many feet higher than

it has been since its discovery in 160S. The wa-
ters generally rise from about the 20th of April to
the 20th of June, from four to six feet ; the great-
est variation is not more than eight feet. It is sel-
dom entirely shut up Avith ice until the middle of
January, Between the 6th and 15th of April the
ice generally goes off, and it is not uncomtiAon for
many square miles of it to disappear in one day.]

==[[Cham Rle|CHAM RLE]]==, a large unpeopled tract of the
province of [[Taraumara]], and kingdom of [[Nueva]]
Vizcaya, in which there is a mountain abounding
greatly in silver mines. Here is also a mission

pany for the reduction of the natives : is 12
leagues n. e. of the town of Santa Eulalia.

==[[Champoton|CHAMPOTON]]==, a river of the province and

mala. It empties itself into the S. sea near the li-
mits of this jurisdiction, and of that of Chiriqui in
the kingdom of [[Tierra Firme]].

==[[Chamula|CHAMULA]]==, a settlement of the province and

==[[Chancaillo|CHANCAILLO]]==, a small port of the S. sea, in
the province and corregimiento of [[Chancay]], to
the n. of Lima ; little frequented, from lying ex-

the kingdotn of [[Peru]] ; bounded n. by that of San-

of Cauta; and s. by the corregimiento of [[Cercado]].
It is 27 leagues in length from n. to s. and the
same in Avidth e. w. and has on its coast some ports
and creeks not remarkable for their security. It
comprehends in its district two territories, one of
a cold temperature toAvards the cordillera^ called
De los Cbecras; and another of a Avarm tempera-
ture, lying in the valleys towards the sea, called
De Chancay. It is irrigated by tAvo rivers, one
on the s. side, called Pasamayo, and the other
Huama, on the n. The latter has an arched bridge,
which Avas built in the time of the viceroy, the
Marquis de Montes Claros, the buttresses of Avhich
are tAvo rocks, through Avhich the river passes.
On the e. and in the cold part of this province,
are found the productions peculiar to the cli-
mate, such as ocas, and some Avheat and
maize. Here are also cattle, ot the fleeces of which
