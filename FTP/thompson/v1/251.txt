==[[Camamu]]==, a river of the same province and
kingdom, which rises in the sierra Chapada, runs
to e. and empties itself into the sea, close bj the
sand-bank of its name.

==[[Camabiu]]==, Sand-bank of, lying at the mouth of
the river of the same name, wiicre there is a fort or
castle, called Nuestra Sehora de Gracia, to defend
the entrance of the river.

==[[Camana|CAMANA]]==, a province and corregbnknto of
[[Peru]] ; bounded n. w. and n. by the province of
Ica, n. e. by that of Lucaruis, e. by that of
Parinacochas and Condesuios, s.e. by that of Col-
lahuas, and w. by the S. sea. It extends in length
25 leagues, from the n. w. to the s. e. extremities,
and in its witlest part from e. to zo. it is 14 leagues.
It is composed of many valleys, which for the most
part terminate on the coast, and are thus called,
viz. Mage.'-, Camana, Quilca, Ocoila, Atico, Cha-
parra, Chala, Yauca, and Acari. To the s. and
before the valley of Mages, there lies a valley of
the name of Sihuas, which is 10 leagues in length.
The five valleys towards the s. belong to the tem-
poral jurisdiction of this province ; but inasrairch
as relates to the ecclesiastical jurisdiction, appertain
to the province of [[Collahuas]]. All these valleys
abound in pimento, vines, of which they make wine
and brandy ; with figs and seeds, particularly in
Mages; with these productions a large commerce
is carried on with the neighbouring provinces.
The temperature here is similar to that of Lima.
Towards the sierra, rain is not unfrequent, and in
that part are many mines of gold, which, however,
owing to the hardness of the metals, the immense
expences of working, and the great mixture of
alloy, render but little profit. Here are also mines
of copper, and upon a very lofty mountain called
Huantiapa, arc mines of crystal of various colours.
All these valleys are irrigatetl by rivulets running
down from the sierra; and many of these swell
prodigiously in the rainy months, which are Ja-
nuary, February, and March. The rest of the
year these valleys suffer much from drought, with
the exception of those of Mages and Ocona, which
are always well watered Avith streams abounding
in king-fish, lisas, and prawns. In the former
valley, in particular, is found an animal much re-
sembling a cat, which lives upon these king-fish.
This province is poor, and its inherbitants are a
wretciied race, dispersed over many valleys, and
living upon dried figs instead of bread. There
are various creeks upo?i the coast, in which fish
are caught in considerable quantities, and carried
to be sold in the sierra. Tlvere are also some small
islands where they go to collect hunnco, which is
the dung of a certain bird, and used for manuring

the valleys. The repartimienlo in this province
formerly amounted to 52,600 dollars, and it paid
yearly 420 for aJcaxala. Its population is con-
tained in 14 settlements, which are,

==[[Quilca]]==, Valle de Chaparra,

==[[Aplao]]==, Tocotay,

==[[Huancarqui]]==, Atiquipa,

Chala,

==[[Y^auca]]==,

==[[Yaqui]]==.

==[[Camana]]==, the capital of the abov'e province, is
situate two leagues from the sea, on a beautiful
and delightful spot. It is watered by the Mages,
jiist before this river enters the sea, where it takes
its course round a most charming grove tenanted
by a variety of birds. The population was for-
merly large, but at present its inhabitants scarcely
amount to the number of 1500 souls, owing to the
greater part of them having emigrated to Arequipa.
There is a small bay on the coast, of the same
name, where quantities of fish are caught. [Lai.
