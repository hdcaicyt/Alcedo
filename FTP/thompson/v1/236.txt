dies, for other parts. The parish church is the
convent of St. Francisco. Just out of the town
is a pleasant valley, extending' four leagues in
length and two in breadth, in which are various
pastures, wild cattle, and other cultivated lands,
Avhicli cause the commerce to be very considerable.
Seventeen leagues to the n, w. of its capital.

==[[Cadaja|CADAJA]]==, a lake of the country of the Amazo-
nas, near to the river Puru, or Cuchivara.

==[[Cadaroses|CADAROSES]]==, a lake of the province of [[New]]
York, near the river Hudson, and the fort of Sa-
ratoga.

[==[[Caddoques|CADDOQUES]]==. See Cadodaques.]

==[[Cadereita|CADEREITA]]==, a capital town of the alcaldia
mayor and jurisdiction of this name in Nueva
Espana, founded in the year 1637, by order of
the viceroy, Marquis of Cadereita, who called it
after his title. It is situate on the skirt of the
Sierra Gorda, on the mountains and in the hollows
of which the Fames Indians live retired. These
have never embraced the Catholic religion, not-
withstanding the endeavours of the religious order
of San Francisco. These barbarous infidels, Avho
are increasing in numbers daily, keep this district
in a continual state of warfare, having possession
of the craggy descents and egresses of the sierra.
They are much reduced, and consist only of some
honics and scattered families ; and thus both these,
as well as the inhabitants of the capital, amounting
to about 760 families of Spaniards, Mulattoes, and
Mustees, gain their livelihood by working at the
mines of silver Avhich are found in this district, as
well as in the sierra. These mines are not very
productive or advantageous, on account of the
poverty of the neighbourhood, and the great ex-
pence of labour. The town is situate in the val-
ley of St. Juan, in a small island formed by two
rivers, the one called Silla, which descends from
the sierra^ and the other taking its rise from some
springs of Avater, known by the name of Santa
Lucia. It has a very good parish church, and
convent of San Francisco. Its situation is cheer-
ful, and its soil very fertile. It is supplied with
water from the river at some distance by means of
a fine aqueduct. Much wheat, maize, French
beans, and pulse, grow in its territory, and it is
famous for the breed of mules and horses. Forty-
five leagues n. of Mexico. [Long. 99° 22'. Lat.
20° 24'.]

==[[Cauekeita]]==, AA’ith the dedicatory title of San
Juan, another settlement of the ncAV kingdom of
Leon, founded by the same viceroy as the former.
Its district abounds in cattle, both of the larger and
smaller kind ; but it is badly provided with grain
and fruits. Many infidel Indians dwell about the

suburbs, though without any communication with
the town. Here is a convent of the order of San
Francisco. Nine leagues s. e. of its capital.

==[[Cadiz|CADIZ]]==, a capital city of the isle of Cubagua,
founded in the year 1547 by lacome CasteUon.
Its commerce was formerly very considerable,
owing to its pearl fisheries ; but when these Avere
no longer carried on, it declined greatly.

==[[Cadiz]]==, a village in the island of [[Cuba]], situate
on the n. coast, between Caragayas and La Crux
del Principe. [It is near 160 miles e. of Havannah,
and 50 n. from Spiritu Santo.]

==[[Cadodaques|CADODAQUES]]==, a small settlement of In-
dians of Louisiana, situate on the shore of the
river Rouge, or Roxo. [These Indians live about
35 mites w. of the main branch of the Red river,
on a hayau or creek, called by them Sodo, which
is navigable for peroques only within about six
miles of their village, and that only in the rainy
season. They are distant from Natchitoches
about 120 miles, the nearest route by land, and
in nearly a. n. w. direction. They have lived
where they noAV do only five years. The first
year they moved there the small-pox got amongst
them, and destroyed nearly one half of them ; it
was in the winter season, and they practised plung-
ing into the creek on the first appearance of the
eruption, and died in a few hours. Some few
years ago they had the measles, of which several
more of them died. They formerly lived on the
s. bank of the river, by the course of the river 375
miles higher up, at a beautiful praire, Avhich has
a clear lake of good water in the middle of it, sur-
rounded by a pleasant and fertile country, which
had been the residence of their ancestors from time
immemorial. They have a traditionary tale
which not only the Caddos, but half a dozen other
smaller nations believe in, who claim the honour
of being descendants of the same family : they say,
when all the Avorld Avas drowned by a flood that
inundated the Avhole country, the great spirit
placed on an eminence, near this lake, one family
of Caddoques, who alone were saved ; from that
family all the Indians originated. The French,
for many years before Louisiana Avas transferred
to Spain, had at this place a fort and some
soldiers; several French families were likewise
settled in the vicinity, where they had erected a
good flour mill with burr stones brought from
France. These French families continued there
till about 25 years ago, when they moved down
and settled at Campti, on the Red river, about 20
miles above Natchitoches, where they now live ;
and the Indians left it about 14 years ago, on ac-
count of a dreadful sickness that visited them.
