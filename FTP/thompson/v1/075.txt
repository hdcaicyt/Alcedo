dreadful one ■wliicli happened in 1707. It is not
deficient in cattle, and its wild wax is similar to
that of Mainas. This island was first discovered,
about the year 1623, by Sir Thomas Warner,
and the English established themselves in it in
1636. The king of England granted it, in 1663,
to William Willoughby, who sent to it, in 1666, a
numerous colony to people it. It was the same
year attacked and ravaged by the French, from
whom it was retaken, in 1690, by Christopher
Codrington. In 1736, three Indians, by name
Court, Tombay, and Ilecules, entered into a
conspiracy to put some gunpowder in a situation
that it might explode and blow up a saloon in
which the governor was giving a ball and enter-
tainment ; but it was timely discovered, and the
conspirators met with the punishment they de-
served.

[==[[Antigua lies between lat]]==. 17° and 17° 12' n.
and between long. 61° 38' and 61° 53' zo. ; is situate
about 20 leagues to the e. of St. Christopher’s ;
and was discovered at the same time with that
island by Columbus himself, who named it from
a church in Seville, Santa Maria de la Antigua.
We are informed by Ferdinand Columbus, that
that the Indian name was Jamaica. It is a singu-
lar circumstance, that this word, which in the
language of the larger islands signified a country
abounding in springs, should, in the dialect of
the Charibbes, have been applied to an island
that has not a single spring or rivulet of fresh
water in it, notwithstanding what Alcedo asserts.

==[[This inconvenience]]==, witlsout doubt, as it ren-
dered the country uninhabitable to the Charibbes,
deterred for some time the European adventurers
in the neighbouring islands from attempting a
permanent establishment in Antigua; but nature
presents few obstacles which the avarice or indus-
try of civilized man will not endeavour to sur-
mount. The lands were found to be fertile, and
it was discovered that the water preserved in the
cisterns was wonderfully light, pure, and whole-
some. So early as 1632, a few English families
took up lands there, and began the cultivation of
tobacco.

==[[But the settlement was nearly strangled in its
infancy]]==. The attack by the French, in 1666, has
been already mentioned. It was then that the
island was invaded and ravaged with fire and
sword. All the Negroes that could be found
were taken away ; and the iidiabitants, after be-
holding their houses and estates in flames, were
plundered even to the clothes on their backs and the
shoes on their feet, without regard to sex or age.

==[[Its Recovery From This Calamity Was Owing
Chiefly To The Enterprising Spirit And Extensive
Views Of Colonel Codrtngton Of Barbadoes|Its recovery from this calamity was owing
chiefly to the enterprising spirit and extensive
views of Colonel Codrtngton of Barbadoes]]==. This
gentleman removing to Antigua about the year
1674, applied his knowledge in sugar-planting
with such good effect and success, that others,
animated by his example, and assisted by his ad-
vice and enco!iragement, adventured in the same
line of cultivation. Mr. Codrington was some
years afterwards nominated captain-general and
commander-in-chief of all the Leeward Charibbeau
islands ; and deriving from the appointment the
power of giving greater energy to his benevolent
purposes, had soon the happiness of beholding
the good effects of his humanity and wisdom, in
the flourishing condition of the several islands un-
der his government.

==[[The Prosperity Of Antigua Was Manifested In
Its Extensive Population; For When|The prosperity of Antigua was manifested in
its extensive population; for when]]==, in the year
1690, General Codrington commanded on the ex-
pedition against the French inhabitants of St.
Christopher’s, Antigua furnished towards it no
less than 800 effective men : a quota which gives
room to estimate the whole number of its white
inhabitants, at that time, at upwards of 5000.

==[[About 34]]==,000 acres of land in this island are
appropriated to the growth of sugar, and pastur-
age annexed ; its other principal staples arc cot-
ton-wool, ginger, and tobacco ; and they raise
in favourable years great quantities of provisions.

==[[This island contains two different kinds of soil :
the one a black mould on a substratum of clay]]==,
which is naturally rich, and when not checked by
excessive droughts, to which Antigua is particu-
larly subject, very productive ; the other is a
stift’clayon a substratum of marl ; it is much less
fertile than the former, and abounds with an
irradicable kind of grass, in such a manner, that
many estates, consisting of that kind of soil, wliich
were once very profitable, are now so impoverish-
ed and overgrown w itii this sort of grass, as either
to be converted into pasture land, or to become
entirely abandoned. Exclusive of such deserted
land, and a small part of the country that is alto-
gether unimprovable, every part of the island may
be said to be under cultivation.

==[[The island is divided into six parishes and 1 1
districts]]==. The parishes are, St. John’s, St. Mary’s,
St. George, St. Peter, St. Paul, and St. Philip.
It has six towns and villages : St. John’s, (the
capital), Parham, Falmouth, Willoughby Bay,
Old Bay, Old Road, and James Fort ; the two
first of which are legal ports of entry. No island
in this part of the West Indies can boast of so]
