==[[Canada|CANADA]]==, or New France, a province and
colony of N. America, the limits of which are
esteemed various, and have in fact been the
occasion of many disputes and wars between the
French and the English. Some maintain that it
extends from Florida to the extremity of N. Ame-
rica, or from 33° to 65° n. lat. ; but the country
properly called Canada is a small part of the
above territory, situate s. and e. of the river St.
Lawrence. Others assert that its limits are, on
the n. the land of Labrador or New Britain, on
the e. the N. sea and New England, on the s.
Florida, and on the w. Nuevo Mexico ; according
to which, it would extend itself from 25° to 53° n.
lat. and from 76° to 93° w. long, but the utmost of
its extent is commonly taken from s. w. to n. e.
that is, from the province of [[Padoan]] in Nueva
Espana to cape Charles in the bay of St. Law-
rence, which computes to about 900 leagues. The
Baron of Hontam allows its limits to reach only
from 39° to 65° of lat. that is, from the s. part of
lake Erie to the n. of Hudson’s bay, and in
length from the river Mississippi to Race cape in
Newfoundland. According to the late observa-
tions of Mr. Beilin, the province of Louisiana ex-
tends many degrees farther to tlie w. of the above
river. Tlie climate of Canada is very various t-
The whole of the part inhabited by the French, to
the shore of the ri ver St. Lawrence, is excessively
cold during the wisder, although hot in summer;
the other parts, as far as has at present been dis-
covered, contain immense forests, lakes, and rivers^
and the cold is there very great. Nevertheless,
fertile jrlaius are not wanting, which produce all-
kinds of grain, fruits, and plants ; of the latter the
tobacco plant is most abundant, and is particularly
cultivated by the French. The forests abound in
deer, dnntas, wild cats, bulls, many kinds of goats,
wolves, and other animals ; also in a variety of
birds. The [)lains, vHuch are well irrigated, aflbrd
excellent pastures, in which breed numerous herds
