purchase, obtained an act of incorporation, Sep-
tember 3, 1655 ; and this was the most distant
settlement from the sea-shore of New England at
that time. The settlers never liad any contest with
the Indians ; and only three persons were ever kill-
ed by them within the limits of the town. In
1791, there were in this township 225 dwelling
lionses, and 1590 inhabitants ; of the latter there
were 80 persons upwards ot 70 years old. For 13
years previous to 1791, the average number of
deaths was 17 ; one in four of whom were 70 years
old and upwards. The public buildings are, a
Congregational church, a spacious stone gaol, the
best in New England, and a very handsome county
court-house. The town is accommodated with
three convenient bridges over the river ; one of
which is 208 feet long, and 18 feet wide, supported
by 12 piers, built after the manner of Charles river
bridge. This town is famous in the history of the
revolution, having been the seat of the provincial
congress in 1774, and the spot where the first op-
position was made to the British troops, on the
memorable 19th of April 1775. The general
court have frequently held their sessions here when
contagious diseases have prevailed in the capital.

remarkable for the gentleness of its current, which
is scarcely perceivable by the eye. At low water
mark it is from 100 to 200 feet wide, and from three
to 12 feet deep. During floods. Concord river
is near a mile in breadth ; and when viewed from
the town of Concord, makes a fine appearance.]

==[[Condesuios De Arequipa|CONDESUIOS DE Arequipa]]==, a province
and corregimiento of [[Peru]] : bounded n. by that of
Parinocochas, e. by that of Chumbivilcas, s. e.
by that of Canes and Canches, and s. by that of
Collahuas. It is generally of a cold temperature,
even in the less lofty parts of the cordillera ; of
a rough and broken territory, and with very bad
roads. Nevertheless, no inconsiderable proportion
of wheat is grown in the low grounds, as likewise of
maize, and other seeds and fruits, such as grapes,
pears, peaches, apples, and some flowers. Upon
tlie heights breed many vicunas, huanacos, and
vizcachas, and in other parts is obtained cochineal,
here called macno, and which is bartered by the
Indians for baizes of the manufacture of the country,
and for cacao. It has some gold mines which
were worked in former times, and which, on ac-
count of the baseness of the metal, the depth of the
mines, and hardness of the strata, have not pro-
duced so much as formerly they did, although
they are not now without yielding some emolu-
ment : such are those of Airahua, Quiquimbo,
Araure, and Aznacolea, which may produce a
little more than the expences incurred in Avorkirig
them. The gold of these mines is from 19 to 20
carats, and they produce from tliree to four ounces
each cfljjow. They are Avorked by means of steel
and powder, and the metals are ground in mills.
The greater part of the natives of tliis province oc-
cupy themselves in carrying the productions of the
valley of Mages, of the province of [[Carnana]], such
as Avines and brandies, to the other provinces of
the sierra; also in the cultivation of seeds, and
some in working the mines. It is watered by some
small rivers or streams, which, incorporate them-
selves, and form t-wm large rivers. The capital is
