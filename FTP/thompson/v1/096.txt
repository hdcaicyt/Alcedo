==[[Arica|ARICA]]==, a province and corregimienio of [[Peru]],
bounded on the n. by that of Moquehua, n. w. by
the jurisdiction of Arequipa, w. by the S. sea, s.
by the province of [[Atacamas]], s. e, by that of
Lipes, and e. by that of Pecajes. It is in length
82 leagues n. w. s. e. and 16 in width e. w. It
is composed, as are the other provinces on the
coast, of valleys, which begin in the uneven
grounds and windings of the cordillera, and
which, for the most part, terminate on the shore
of the S. sea. The parts lying between the val-
leys in this province are dry and unfruitful, and
only serve for pastures in those months in which
the gently sprinkling rain falls which is called
garua, from May to September. In those val-
leys, which are, generally speaking, fertile, since
they do not suffer from drought, is grown a suf-
ficient supply of wheat, maize, and other seeds ;
also much Guiney pepper is cultivated, with
which a commerce is carried on with the other
provinces of the sierra, and a good quantity of
cotton, olives, and sugar. In the 17th century,
the aforesaid pepper grown on this province might
be reckoned to produce the yearly value of
200,000 dollars. It does not want for wines or
brandies ; and of the vine plant, the most celebrated
is that of the valley of Locumba, on account of itf
flavour. In the mountains towards the cordillera,
cattle of the larger anl smaller soil are bred, also
native sheep. It has the fruits peculiar to its
temperature, such as papas and some wheat, es-
pecially in the curacy of llabaya, by which the
adjoining town of Moquehua finds a regular sup-
ply. In order to render the land fertile, the
husbandmen make use of huano, which is the
dung of birds called huanaes, and is brought
from an island close upon the coast, called Iqueine.
