==[[Barquisimeto Or Bariquisimeto|BARQUISIMETO or Bariquisimeto]]==, This
city was (according to Depons) founded 15 years
before the city of Caracas: it lies on a plain of such
an elevation as to allow it the enjoyment of every
refreshing breeze that blows ; and owing to this for-
tunate situation, the excessive heat experienced here
becomes supportable. The thermometer of Reau-
mur rises to 28° or 29° whenever the rays of the
sun do not meet, in the atmosphere, any thing to
moderate their heat. The most prevalent wind is
the w. e. The inhabitants find in the plains, the
valleys, and on the hills forming the environs of
the cit}', the means of exercising, according to
their inclination, their industry and application.
The excellent pasture in the plains renders the
rearing of all sorts of animals for commerce easy,

==[[A Great Many People Prefer This Kind Of Specu 
Lation|A great many people prefer this kind of specu-

cultivate the sugar-cane and wheat. The valleys
by tlieir verdure, preserved to them by means of
canals, produce abundantly the best cacao, and
the hills have for some time past been planted with
coffee, whicii, to be excellent, only requires a more
careful preparation. To consider merely the vast
quantity of fertile land in the neighbourhood of
Barquisiraeto, which can be watered and which
remains uncultivated, one would be inclined to
accuse the inhabitants of indolence : but in ex-
tending our views to the plantations of all sorts of
produce, and to the animals spread over the plains;
in contemplating too the great difficulty in the
carriage of merchandize to the sea-ports, the nearest
and most frequented of which is at a distance of
50 leagues, one is rather inclined to think favour-
ably of their industry. The city consists of 3300
persons, rvho live very comfortably ; the houses
are well built, the streets in parallel lines, and wide
enough for the free circulation of air. The paro-
chial church is handsome, and the duty is per-
formed by two curates. A cabildo and a lieute-
nant of the governor perform the functions of the
police, and of the administration of justice. It is
80 leagues w.s.w. of Caracas, 150 leagues «.;j.e.
of Santa Fe, and 15 leagues n. e. of Tocuyo.]
