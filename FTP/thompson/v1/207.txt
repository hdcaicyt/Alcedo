fDutch, by an ill-judged parsimony, joined to a
number of unfortunate and unforeseen circum-
stances, relinquish a conquest which, under a
more liberal policy, might have become one of
the richest and most flourishing of the European
colonies in the new world. The sensation created,
in the mother country by the news of this untoward
event, and the fury with which they demanded
justice against General Sigismund Schuppen, who
]iad commanded in chief many years in [[Brasil|Brazil]],
and was governor of the Receitfe at the time of its
surrender, is perfectly inconceivable. The States,
in order to protect him and his officers from the
resentment of an enraged populace, found it ne-
cessary to send them to prison. In this situation
the general earnestly entreated to be suffered to
-make a public defence ; and in this he recapitu-
lated with so much clearness his own long and
faithful services, and the splendid successes he
Jiad obtained under the administration of Count
Maurice, while at the same time he drew such a
faithful picture of the misfortunes and hardships
whicii he and his brave companions in arms had
lately sustained, that the audience dissolved into
tears, and his judges honourably acquitted him.

8. Siafe of [[Brasil|Brazil]] at that time. — To conclude :
when count Maurice, after residing eight years in
Brazil, relinquished the government, he left seven
captainships, one city, 30 large towns, 45 regular
fortresses, 90 sail of ships, 3000 regular troops,
20,000 Dutch, 60,000 Negroes, and about twice
the number of native Brazilians : but, after the
expenditure of several millions of money, and the
destruction of several thousands of lives, there re-
turned to Holland, in 1655, only between 6 and
700 individuals, and these wholly destitute of
property.

==[[The Peace Which V/As A Short Time Before This
Period Concluded Between England And The United
Provinces|The peace which v/as a short time before this
period concluded between England and the United
Provinces]]==, seemed to leave tlie lalter at liberty
to attempt the recovery of this valuable settle-
ment.

9. Treaty of ]66\. — But the general expecta-
tion, which anticipated this event, was disap-
pointedly the treaty, which put an end to the
hostilities between the two powers in 1661, and by
which the [[Brasil|Brazil]]s were secured to the crown of
Portugal, in considerpiion of 8,000,000 of livres,
(333, ’33/. 6^. 6d.), wliich that government 'en-
gaged to pay, either in money or goods, to the
United Provinces.

==[[Since the above period]]==, the Portuguese have
T-emained in quiet possession of this extensive
country. The treaty, which delivered them from
the presence of an enemy by whom they had been

so often humbled, was no sooner executed, than
the court of Lisbon began to consider the best
means of securing the future tranquillity, and in-
creasing the riches, of their possessions.

==[[The Portuguese Visited The River Plata Shortly
After The Spaniards ; But Whatever Might Be Their
Views In This Excursion|The Portuguese visited the river Plata shortly
after the Spaniards ; but whatever might be their
views in this excursion]]==, it does not appear that
they endeavoured to form any settlement on it till
1553, at which period they proceeded as far
as Buenos Ayres, and took possession of the n.
coast of the Spanish provinces in that quarter.
This transaction seems to have been overlooked
by the Spanish government, till the court of Lis-
bon proceeded, in 1600, to found the colony of [[St]].
Sacrament, at the extremity of the territory hither-
to claimed by Spain. Hence arose a new source
of jealousy and animosity, which gave rise to the
most violent contests between these rival powers,
and eventually stained the river Plata with blood.

10. Variance and reconciliation between the
Spanish and Portuguese. — Spain contended that
the new colony was planted in the space allotted
to her by the Popes, a truth which the Portuguese
attempted not to deny, but they mait)tained that
this tract was yielded up to them by later agree-
ments, and particularly by the treaty of 1668.
After various acts of hostilities, in which the rising
walls of the colony had been destroj'^ed, and the
Portuguese expelled, it was agreed, in 1681, that
they should be re-instated in possession of the
post they had been compelled to abandon, but that
the inhabitants of Buenos Ayres should have an
equal right with themselves to the enjoyment of
the disputed territory.

==[[This provisional treaty was how'ever abrogated
during the war which broke out between the two
crowns at the commencement of the last century ;
in consequence of which]]==, the Portuguese, in 1705,
were again expelled from St. Sacrament. It was
once more, however, ceded to them by the treaty
of Utrecht, as well as the exclusive possession of
the whole territory in dispute.

==[[No sooner had hostilities ceased betw'een these
rival crowns]]==, than the inhabitants of St. Sacra-
ment, and those of Buenos Ayres, impelled by
their mutual wants and conveniences, entered into
a considerable contraband trade with eacli other,
in which it appears that all parts of [[Brasil|Brazil]] and of
[[Peru]], and even some nierchatits of the mother
countries, were more or less engaged.

11. Interference of old Spain. — The Spanish
government, uneasy at perceiving the treasures of
the new world diverted into any other channel,
with that short-sighted policy which marked all
its councils in respect to its South American pos-'J
