opposite tlie seUlement of San Antonio de Cocuisas,
and on the s. side, this river tlirows out an arm,
which is called Apurito, through which it dis-
charges nearly a fourth part of its waters ; and
thus separating itself from the mother stream, it
traverses a great part of those llanos, sometimes iji
the main branch, and at others divided into various
lesser streams, forming sundry islands ; and these
again tiniting, receive the waters of the Arauca,
which flows down from the llanos of Cazanare,
and enters the Orinoco. The main body of the
Apurc, after receiving the river Portugnesa,
throws out an arm to the n. which runs to unite it-
self Avith the Guarico, in the province of [[Venezuela]],
and then empties itself into the Orinoco. The re-
gulars of the company of the Jesuits did not find
any settlements of missionaries on the shore of this
river, as, in fact, all the settlements that were
founded by them were at some distance from it.
[The Apure (observes Depons) rises in the neigh-
bouring mountains of St. Christopher, belonging
to the kingdom of [[Santa]] Fe ; its length is 170
leagues, of which 40 are from n. e. to s. e. and the
remainder from w. to e. it then takes its course to
the s. to join the Orinoco. It is navigable for
more than 60 leagues, and in its course increases
the volume of its Avaters by a number of other rivers,
of which some are also navigable, and the more
useful, because, after having irrigated a great part
of Venezuela, they serve for the conveyance of the
produce which springs from the luxuriance they
afford to the soil. These rivers are' the Tinaco,
San Carlos, Cojeda, Aguablanca, Acarigua, Are,
Yaruo, Hospiria, Abaria, Portuguesa, Guanare,
Tucupido, Bocono, Masparro, La Yuca, St. Do-
mingo, Paguey, Tisnados, &c. These succes-
sively confound their waters in the immense plains
of Venezuela. Almost the whole of them are
united above Santiago, and form a considerable
volume of water, which, at twelve leagues below
that place falls into the Apure, 20 leagues n. of the
Orinoco. This quantity of Avater being too much
for the bed of the Apure to contain, is forced into a
division of many branches, and so falls by several
mouths into the Orinoco. The cattle bred upon
the banks of the Apure, and of the other rivers
which lose their names in joining its waters, consist
of numerous droves, and are highly esteemed.
They are principally oxen, horses, and mules, but
chiefly the latter. Their exportation is naturally
by Guayana, through the accommodation of the
pastures in that route up to the Orinoco. All
the part of Venezuela, forming the new province
of Barinas, and even all its s. part, are invited by
the facility of the transport to send their coffee,

cotton, and indigo, to Guayana, instead of carry-
ing them on mules to Caracas or Puerto Cuballo,
over a hundred leagues, on roads almost impracti-
cable, and crossed by rivers nearly iinbounded.]

==[[Apubimac|APUBIMAC]]==, a large river of the province of
Abancny in Pern ; it rises in it, and following a n.
cours'“, passes through Cuzco, uniting itselfafter-
wards Avitli those of Santiago and Pachachaca, and
after running 120 leagues through the mountains
of the Andes, it enters the Maranon with the name
of Ucayale, in such an augmented stream that it is
difficult to ascertain which is the tributary one ; it
then, by the force of its waters alone, is obliged to
change the direction of its course. Some have
» maintained that this river is truly the Maranon,
founding their opinion on its remote origin. It
traverses the high road Avhich leads from Lima
to Cuzco, and other provinces of the sierra. It
is crossed by a bridge, made of thongs or cords,
of SO yards long and three Avide, at Avhich there
is paid a toll of four reals for every parcel of goods
of the country, and 12 reals for such as are of Spain.
Some bagres are caught in this river.
