rdistinguished for being very sure-footed and active.
The horned cattle have, through the favourable
temperature of the climate, acquired a larger size,
while their flesh has become better and more nu-
tritive ; the sheep imported from Spain retain a
wool as beautiful as that of the best Spanish sheep,
each sheep yielding annually from 10 to 15 lbs. of
wool ; they breed twice a-year, and have gene-
rally two at a birth. The common price of cattle
throughout the country is from three to four
filippi (fifteen or twenty francs), but in the sea-
ports the price is fixed by an ancient regulation,
at 10 crowns ; of which the commandant of the
port receives four, and the owner six.

leaves : amongst the plants, there are 3000 not
mentioned in botanical works. _The melons here
are, according to Molina, three feet long, and the
only fruits unknown are medlars, service apples,
three-grained medlar, and the jujubre. Of the
indigenous worms, insects, &c. are 36 species,
andthetunicated cuttle-fish found here is of 150 lbs.
weight. There are 13 species of crabs and craw-
fish found on the sea-coast, and four species in the
fresh waters. There are 135 species ofland-birds,
and of quadrupeds 36, without those imported.
The various kinds of esculent fish found upon the
coast are computed by the fishermen at 76, the most
of them differing from those of the n. hemisphere,
and appearing to be peculiar to that sea.

==[[Amongst the earths of this country is a clay
thought to be very analogous to kaolin of the
Chinese ; another kind called roro]]==, producing an
excellent black dye, and represented by Feuille
and Frazier as superior to the best European
blacks. The membraneous mica^ otherwise Mus-
covy grass, is also found here in the greatest per-
fection, both as respects its transparency and the
size of its laminae ; of this substance the country
people manufacture artificial flowers, and like the
Russians, make use of it for glazing their houses.
The thin plates which are used for windows are by
many preferred to glass, from their being pliable
and less fragile, and possessing what appears to be
a peculiar property, of freely admitting the light
and a view of external objects to those within,
while persons without are prevented from seeing
any thing in the house.
