==[[Crt Arcas|CrtARCAS]]==, an extensive province of the king-

risdiction comprehends the district of this royal
audience, which begins at Vilcanota, of the cor-
regimiento of Lampa and bishopric of Cuzco, and
extends as far as Buenos Ayres to the s. It is
bounded on the e. by [[Brasil|Brazil]], the meridian serving
as a limit ; and reaching w. as far as the corregi-
miento of Atacama, which is of its district, and
forms the most n. part of this province in that di-
rection, and being closed in on its other sides by
the kingdom of [[Chile]] : is 300 leagues in length, in-
cluding the degrees of latitude from 20° to 28° s . :
is in many parts very thinly peopled, and covered
with large desert tracts, and rugged and impene-
trable mountains, and again by the elevated cordil-
leras of the Andes, and the spacious llanuras or
pampas, which serve to mark its size and the relative
distances of its territories. Its temperature through-
out is extremely cold, although there are not want-
ing parts which enjoy a moderate warmth. At the
time that this province was in the possession of the
Indians, and previous to the entrance of the Spa-
niards, many well-inhabited provinces went jointly
under the name of Charcas ; and the conquest of
these was first undertaken by Capac Yupanqui,
fifth Emperor ; but he was not able to pass the ter-
ritory of the Tutiras Indians and of Chaqui. Here
it was that his conquests terminated : nor did the
subjection of these parts extend farther than Col-
laysuyo until after his death, when he was suc-
ceeded by his son the Inca Roca, sixth Emperor,
who carried on still farther the victories which had
been already gained, conquering all the nations as
far on as that of Chuquisaca, where he afterwards
founded the city of this name, called also La Plata.
After that the Spaniards had reduced that part of
Peru, extending from Tumbez to Cuzco, and that
the civil wars and dissensions which existed be-
tween these were at an end, they endeavoured to
follow up their enterprise by making a conquest of
the most distant nations. To this end, in 1538,
Gonzalo Pizarro sallied forth with a great force,
and attacking the Charcas and the Carangues,
found in them such a spirited opposition, that after
several battles he was brought to think this object
was nearly impracticable : this idea was strength-
ened by the reception he had met with from the
Chuquisacas, who in many conflicts had given him
convincing proofs of their valour and warlike
spirit ; indeed it is thought, that had he not just
