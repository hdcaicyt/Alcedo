appears to be coeval with the creation of the
■world. It rises abrnptij, and forms but a small
angle Avitli its base ; its general shape being that of
a pyramid, crowned at intervals with conical, and,
as it were, crystallized elevations. It is composed
of primitive rocks of quartz, of an enormous size,
and almost uniform configuration, containing no
marine substances, which abound in the secondary
mountains. It is in the Cordillera of this part of
the Andes, that blocks of crystal are obtained,
of a size sufficient for columns of six or seven
feet in height. The central Andes are rich, be-
yond conception, in all the metals, lead only
excepted. One of the most curious ores in the
bowels of those mountains is the pacos, a com-
pound of clay, oxyd of iron, and the muriate of
silver, with native silver. The mines of Mexico
and [[Peru]], so long the objects of envy and admira-
tion, far from being yet exhausted, promise, under
a liberal and improved system, to become more
productive than ever. But nature has blended
with those hidden treasures the active aliments of
destruction. The whole chain of the Andes is
subject to the most terrible earthquakes. From
Cotopaxi to the S. sea, no fewer than forty volca-
noes are constantly burning ; some of them, espe-
cially the lower ones, ejecting lava, and others
discharging the muriate of ammonia, scorified
basalt and porphyry, enormous quantities of water,
and especially moya, or clay mixed with sulphur
and carbonaceous matter. Eternal snow invests
their sides, and forms a barrier to the animal and
vegetable kingdoms. Near that confine the tor-
por of vegetation is marked by drenry wastes.
In these wide solitudes, the condor, a fierce and
powerful bird of prey, fixes its gloomy abode. Its
size, however, has been greatly exaggerated.
According to Humboldt, it is not larger than the
lajmmer geyer, or alpine vulture of Europe; its
extreme length being only three feet and a half,
and its breadth across the wings nine feet. The
condor pursues the small deer of the Andes, and
commits very considerable havoc among sheep and
heifers. It tears out the eyes and the tongue, and
leaves the wretched animal to languish and expire.
Estimating from very probable data, this bird
skims whole hours at the height of four miles ; and
its power of wing must be prodigious, and its
pliancy of organs most astonisliing, since in an
instant it can dart from the chill region of raid-air
to tlie sultry shores of the ocean. The condor is
sometimes caught alive, by means of a slip-cord ;
and this chaje, termed correr buitres, is, next to
a bull-fight, the most favourite diversion of the
Spanish colonists. The dead carcase of a cow or

horse soon attracts from a distance crowds of these
birds, which have a most acute scent. They fall
on with incredible voracity, devour tlie eyes and
the tongue of the animal, and plunging through
the anus, gorge themselves with the entrails. In
this drowsy plight they are approached by t!ie
Indians, who easily throw a noose over them.
The condor, thus entangled, looks shy and sullen ;
it is most tenacious of life, and is therefore made to
suffer a variety of protracted tortures. The most
important feature of the American continent, is the
very general and enormous elevation of its soil.
In Europe the highest tracts of cultivated land
seldom rise more than 2000 feet above the sea ;
but in the [[Peru]]vian territory extensive plains
occur at an altitude of 9000 feet ; and three fifths
of the viceroyalty of Mexico, comprehending the
interior provinces, present a surface of half a mil-
lion of square miles, which runs nearly level, at an
elevation from 0000 to 8000 feet, equal to that of
the celebrated passages of Mount Cenis, of St.
Gothard, or of the great St. Bernard. These
remarkable facts are deduced chiefly from barome-
trical observations. But Humboldt lias adopted a
very ingenious mode, infinitely superior to any
description, of representing at one view the col-
lective results of his topographical and mineralo-
gical survey. He has given profiles, or vertical
sections, of the countries which he visited, across
the continent, from Acapulco to Mexico, and
thence to Vera Cruz ; from Mexico to Guanaxu-
ato, and as far as the volcano of Jorullo ; and from
Mexico to Valladolid. These beautiful plates
are in every way highly interesting.]

colony of [[Maryland]]. It runs s. and enters the
Potowmac.

country of the Amazonas, in the Portuguese pos-
sessions, and in the territory of the Natayas In-

the river Abacaclfis.
