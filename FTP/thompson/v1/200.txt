[canons, and dignitaries, and chnrch ornaments of
every kind for his cathedral : he had studied and
graduated at Paris, had held the office of vicar-gene-
ral in India, and, unhappily for himself, was now
sent to Bahia. At this time no better colonists
could be sent out than the clergy , for none were
employed upon this mission except such as were
selected for their peculiar fitness for the service.
From the time of its earliest discovery, the French
had frequented the coasts of [[Brasil|Brazil]], though the
first regular attempt at establishing themselves was
in the liio de Janeiro, under Nicholas Durand de
Villegagnon, in 1558. The wars of the Portuguese
with tile French being a subject of little interest, we
pass on to the period when the kingdom was divided
into two governments, which was in the year 1572.

12. [[Brasil|Brazil]] divided into two governments . — St.
Sebastian’s tvas the seat of the new one, which
began with the captaincy of Puerto Seguro, and
included every thing south of it. The French,
driven as they had repeatedly been from Brazil,
whenever they attempted to form even a factory
there, would not abandon the trade of that coun-
try. They indeed made a stand at Paraiba in
1583, blit even here they were dislodged.

13. Intercourse of the English with [[Brasil|Brazil]]. — It
was about the same time that the subjection of Por-
tugal to Spain had involved Brazil in hostilities
with the English, who till now had never ap-
peared there as enemies, though they had traded
Avith the Indians before the foundation of St. Sal-
vador. Be it observed, that Englishmen &gt;vere
hated by all the Spaniards in America, and were
considered as pirates.

14. Their ex'mditions. — The first act of hos-
tility which the English committed in [[Brasil|Brazil]] was
under Fenton, and in this they were not the ag-
gressors ; but Brazil Avas now become a Spanish
colony, and therefore exposed to the depreciations
of every freebooter. Three years after Fenton’s
return, in 1586, another expedition was destined
for the S. sea, and its instructions were not equally
pacific. The Earl of Cumberland' was at the
charge of this adventure, of which Robert With-
rington had the command ; it was joined by two
other privateers, one of Avhich was fitted oiit by
Raleigh. After this expedition followed two others,
one under Cavendish in 1592, the other under
Lancaster in 1594, both inconsiderable alike in
their means and intent.

little worthy of note ; but the consequence of them
was, that Maranan and Para were separated from
the general government of [[[[Brasil|Brazil]]]] with tlie title
of estado or state, and Francisco Coelho de Car-
valho Avas appointed the first governor. The evil
days however of Brazil Avere now drawing on, and
the Portuguese, instead of extending their settle-
ments in that country,, were on the point of losing
all that they possessed there.

2. A Dutch company formed. — In 1623 a Dutch
company was formed, full powers being given
them, and all other subjects of the United States
being prohibited during a term of 24 years from
trading to America, or to the opposite coast of
Africa, between the cape of Good Hope and the
tropic of Cancer. The company Avere to render
an account of their proceedings every sixth year.
A fleet sailed in December under the command of
Jacob Willekens ; his admiral being the famous
Pieter Heyne, who from being a common sailor
had risen to that rank. The fleet made for St,
Salvador, and this capital was taken with com-
paratively no resistance. The Portuguese were
aware of the value of their colonies ; 100,000 crowns
Avere given by the city of Lisbon towards the
cxpences of government for the deliverance of St.
Salvador ; the Duke of Braganza made a volun-
tary contribution of 20,000, the Duke of Caminha
of 16,500. The nobles, perceiving that for the
first time the court of Madrid was zealous for the
welfare of Portugal, and flattered in that the
king had written to them with his own hand request-
ing their exertions, offered Avith unexampled rea-
diness their persons and property to the public
service. Men who had held the highest offices
embarked as volunteers, among others Affbnso de
Noronha, Avho had been viceroy ih India; nor
Avas there a noble family in Portugal but had some
of its sons in this armament. The capitulation of
the Dutch Avas the natural consequence.

3. War with the Dutch. — In 1629 a Dutch
fleet, consisting of more than fifty sail, under Hen-
rick Loncq, as general in chief, arrived at [[Brasil|Brazil]] ;
Pieter Adrian was admiral ; colonel Wardenburg
commanded the troops. They sailed from Hol-
land in small divisions; eight ships, with the
general on board, fell in with the Spanish fleet
off Teneriffe, and, inferior as they were in num-
bers, beat it oft’. They reached the cape de Ferds
in September, but the forces under Wardenburg
did not sail from the Texel till late in the succeed-
ing month. The whole expedition consisted of
about 7000 men, half of Avhom were soldiers. In
1634 the Dutch commissioners, Avho had been dis-
patched to Europe for reinforcements, returned]
