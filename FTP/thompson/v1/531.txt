==[[Cravo|CRAVO]]==, Santa Barbara dEj a settlement of
the jurisdiction of Santiago de las Atalajas, of the
government of [[Los]] Llanos of the Nuevo Reyno de
Granada. It is on the shore of the large river of its
name, upon a very pleasant mountain plain, very
near to i\\ellanura at the bottom of the mountain, and
where formerly stood the city of San Joseph de
Cravo, founded by the governor of this province in
1644, but which was soon after destroyed. Thctem-
perature here is not so hot as in the other parts of
the province, from its being', as we have before
observed, in the vicinity of t\\e paramos or moun-
taiti deserts. It produces in abundance maize,
plantains, and pucas, of which is made the best
cazave of any in the kingdom, also many trees of
a hard and strong wood, used as a medicine in
spotted fevers, and a specific against poisons, so
that it is much esteemed, and they make of it
drinking cups. Here are other trees, good for
curing the flux, their virtue in this disorder having
been accidentally discovered as follows. A la-
bourer, as he was cutting down one of these trees,
let his hatchet fall upon his foot; but remembering
that by pressing his foot against the tree it would
stop the blood, he did so, and a splinter thus getting
into the wound, the cut soon healed without the
application of any other remedy. Here are large
breeds of horned cattle, and the natives, who
should amount to 100 Indians, and about as many
whites, are much given to agriculture. Eight
leagues from the settlement of Morcote.

==[[Cravo]]==, a river of the former province and go-
vernment. It rises in the province of [[Tunja]], near
the lake of Labranza, passes before the city, to
which it gives its name, and after running many
leagues, enters the Meta.

==[[Cn A Vo|CnAVo]]==, another river, in the district and juris-
diction of Pamplona, of the Nuevo Reyno de
Granada. It rises to the e. of the settlement of
Capitanejo, runs s. s. e. and enters the river Caza-
nare, according to Beilin, in his map of the course
of a part of the Orinoco; and indeed ^\e doubt if
he be not correct. In the woods upon its shores
live some barbarian Indians, the }ietoyes,.Acira-
guas, and Guaibas. its mouth is in tat. 3° SO' n.

[==[[Cref|CREF]]==.KS, an Indian nation, described also
under tfie name of Muskogulge or Muskogee,
in addition to 'which is the following particulars,
from the manuscript joarnal of an infeliigent tra-
veller : “ Coosa river, and its main branches, form
the re. line of settlements or villages of the Creeks,
but their hunting grounds cxtaid 200 miles be-

yond, to the Tombigbee, which is the dividing
line between their coufitry and that of the Chac-
taws. The smallest of their towns have from 20
to 30 ho'.ises in them, and some of them contain
from 130 to 200, that are wholly compact. The
houses stand in clusters of four, five, six, seven,
and eight together, irregularly distributed up and
down the banks of the rivers or small streams.
Each cluster of houses contains a clan or family o
relations, who eat and live in common. Eac!
town has a public square, hot-house, and yard ne.
the centre of it, appropriatad to various pubh
uses. The following are the names of the prin-
cipal towns of the Upper and Lower Creeks that
have public squares ; beginning at the head of the
Coosa or Coosa Hatcha river, viz. Upper Utalas,
Abbacoochees, Natchez, Coosas, Oteetoocheenas,
Pine Catchas, Pocuntullahases, Weeokes, Little
Tallassie, Tuskeegees, Coosadas, Alabamas, Ta-
wasas, Pawactas, Autobas, Auhoba, W eelump-
kees Big,W eelumpkees Little, Wacacoys, Wack-
soy, Ochees. The following towns are in the
central, inland, and high country, between the
Coosa and Taliapoosee rivers, in the district called
the Hillabees, viz. Hillabees, Killeegko, Oakchoys,
Slakagulgas, and Wacacoys; on the waters of
the Taliapoosee, from the head of the river down-
ward, the following, viz. Tuckabatchee, Tehassa,
Totacaga, New Aork, Chalaacpaulley, Logus-
pogus, Oakfuskee, Ufala Little, Ufala Big, Soga-

House, Clewaleys, Coosahatches, Coolamies, Sha-
Vt'anese or Savanas, Kenlsulka, and Mnckeleses.
The towns of the Low'er Creeks, beginning on the
head waters of the Chattahoosee, and so on down-
wards, are Chelu Ninny, Chattahoosee, liohtatoga,
Cowetas, Cussitahs, Chalagatscaor, Broken Arrow,
Euchces several, Hitchatces several, Palachuolo,
Chewackala ; besides 20 towns and villages of
the Little and Big Chehaus, low down on Flint and
Chattahoosee rivers. From their roving and un-
steady manner of living, it is impossible to deter-
mine, 'with much precision, the number of Indians
that comimse tlie Creek nation. General M‘GiI-
livray estimates the number of gun-men to be be-
tween 3 and 6000, exclusive of the Semiuolcs, Avho
are of little or no accosmt in war, except as small
parties of marauders, acting independent of the
general interest of the others. The wliole number
of individuals may be about 23 or 26,000 souls.
Every town and village has one established white
trader in it, and generally a family of whites, who
liave fled from some part of the tfontiers. They
often, to have revenge, and to obtain jdunder that
may be taken, use their influence to scud out pre«
