==[[Acadia|ACADIA]]==, a province and peninsula ofN. Ame-
rica, on the e. coast of [[Canada]], between the island
or bank of Newfoundland and New England, by
which it is bounded on the w. It is more than
100 leagues in length from n. w. to s. e. and nearly
80 in width, from n. e. tos. w. from the gulph of
St. Lawrence to the river Santa Cruz. It was dis-
covered in 1497 by Sebastian Cabot, sent thither
from England by Henry VIL The French, un-
der the command of Jacob Cartier, of St. Maloes,
established themselves here in 1534, in order to
carry on a cod-fishery on the bank of Newfound-
land ; and in 1604, Peter Guest, a gentleman of
the household of Henry IV. of France, was sent by
that king to establish a colony, which he founded
at Port Royal. 'J'he English entered it under
Gilbert Humphry, in consequence of a grant
which had been made to this person by Queen
Elizabeth, and gave it the title of Nova Scotia.
In 1621 King James I. made a donation of it to
the Earl of Stirling ; and in 1627 the French,
commanded by Kirk de la Rochelle, made them-
selves masters of it, destroying all the establish-
ments of the English, who were obliged to sur-
render it up, in 1629, by the treaty of St. Ger-
mains. The French shortly afterwards lost it ; a
Governor Philip having taken possession of it;
but they, however, regained it in 1691, through the
conduct of Mr. De Villebon. In order to settle
the pretensions of the rival courts, commissioners
were, by mutual consent, appointed in the peace
of Riswick, in 1697, to consider which should be
the limits of Nova Scotia and New England ; and
in the peace of Utrecht, it was entirely ceded to the
English, who afterwards returned to it. This
beautiful country contains many rivers and lakes ;
the principal of these is the Rosignol, well stocked
with fish : there are also many woods, full of ex-
cellent timber, and thronged with very singular
birds ; as, for instance, the Colibri, or humming-
bird, and various others. The same w oods abound
in many kinds of fruits and medicinal herbs. It
is very fertile in wheat, maize, pulse of all sorts,
and also produces cattle of various kinds, animals
cf the chase, and abundance of fine fish. Its

principal commerce is in skins and salt fish. The
winter is longer and colder than in Europe. The
capital is Port Royal. — [The name of Acadia v/as
first applied to a tract from the 40th to the 46th
degree of n. lat. granted to De Mons, Nov. 8,
1603, by Henry IV. of France. For the present
state of this country, see Nova Scotia.]
