==[[Arequipa|AREQUIPA]]==, a province and government of
[[Peru]], bounded on the n. by that of Collaguas, e.
by that of Lampa, s. by that of Moquehua and
thatofArica, w. by the S. sea, and n.w. by the
province of [[Cumana]]. It is 16 leagues in length
from n.w. to s.e. and 12 in width at the most. On
its coast is a port, which is insecure, and two creeks.
Its productions, and in which it carries on a com-*
merce with the other provinces, are reduced to
wine, of which 500,000 jars, containing each 22
flasks, are made annually in the valleys of Arequi-
pa, Moquegua, Locumba, Victor, Tacar, Liguas
Mages, &c. It abounds also in wheat, sugar,
maize, and potatoes, but not in meats ; and there-
fore it is obliged to bring these hither from other
parts. Its jurisdiction contains only 1 1 settlements;
and it is watered by the river Tambo, which gives
its name to a very fertile valley, through which it
passes ; and by the Cliile, which is formed from
the water which distils from a cavity of a great
rock, which, on the outside, is extremely dry.

==[[The Capital Is The City Properly Called Arequi 
Pay|The capital is the city properly called Arequi-
pay]]==, which means to say, “It is well, remain
because, in one of the conquests of the Incas, the
victorious army passing through these parts, many

of the captains, attracted by the beauty of the coun-
try, asked permission to form a settlement here,
when they received for answer, ^‘Arequipay.” The
Spaniards founded this city by order of J'rancisco
Pizarro, in 1536, in the valley of Quilca, at 20
leagues distance from the S. sea, on the skirt of
the mountain called Ornate, which is loftier than
the others of the mountains of the sierra which
surround it. This mountain, although always
covered with snow, vomited fire at the time of the
conquest. The chronologer Antonio de Herrera
says, that this city was founded in 1534, and Don
Antonio de Ulloa, in 1539 ; but one and the other
have erred, and we follow the friar Antonio Ca-
lancha, who affirms the first mentioned date by
original documents. Its temperature, notwith-
standing its continual rains, is notoriously dry,
and very benign and salutary. Its edifices are
handsome, and built of stone ; the dwelling-houses
being somewhat like arched vaults, and having no
upper stories, so as to be prepared against the
effects of earthquakes. It is watered by the river
Chile, which is let oft' by sluices to irrigate the en-
virons, and to enrich the fields. It was subjected
to the bishopric of Cuzco till the year 1577, when
Gregory XV. erected it into a cathedral, its first
bishop being Don Francisco Antonio de Ervia, of
the order of St. Domingo. This authority was
immediately extinguished, and then it became sub-
ject to its former dependency until the year 1609,
when it again became the head seat of a bishopric,
the influence of which extends as far as the pro-
vinces of its name, and of those of Cumana, Con-
desuyos, Cailloma, Moquega, and Arica. The
Emperor Charles V. gave it the title of city, on the
15th May 1541, granting it for arms, in 1549, a
volcano vomiting fire from a mountain surrounded
by a river. It has a beautiful fountain of brass in
the Plaza Mayor, or chief square, and a bridge of
magnificent arches upon the river ; three parishes,
and convents of San Francisco, San Domingo, San
Augustin, La Merced, and San Juan de Dios ; a
college which belonged to the regulars of the com-
pany of Jesuits, of Recoletos de San Francisco,
on the other side of the river ; an hospital of Ago-
nizantes, and a college for the instruction of youth ;
monasteries of nuns of Santa Catalina, Santa Te-
resa, and Santa Rosa ; a house of correction for
women, a religious house (bealerio) of Indians,
and two houses of labour, both for men and wo-
men, lately founded. In the city is preserved,
among its archives, a precious monument of some
royal letters patent, in which Philip II. returned
thanks to this city for its having, in times of neces-
sity, supplied to the crown abundant relief, and
