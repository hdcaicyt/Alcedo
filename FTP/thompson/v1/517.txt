upon the loftiest part of that most beautiful lltinura,
from which the prospect is so enchanting ; sliew-
ing on one side the sea, on another the river which
waters tlie precincts, and on another some shady
poplar groves. It is of an extremely benign tem-
perature, and enjoying throughout the year a per-
petual spring, being neither incommoded by heat
nor cold. It is extremely fertile, and abounds in
whatever can conduce to the comfort and conve-
nience of life. The city is tolerably large ; all the
streets are drawn at straight lines ; and the houses
are disjoined from each other by large gardens,
which are all well supplied with water brought by
aqueducts from the river. The parish church is
very beautiful, and not less so are those of the re-
ligious orders of St.. Francis, St. Domingo, St.
Augustin, La Merced, San Juan de Dios, and the
college which formerly belonged to the regulars
of the company of the Jesuits. It has a port,
which is convenient ajid much frequented by ves-
sels ; upon the shore of which are caught tunnies,
abacoras, and various other kinds of fish ; also
many delicate kinds of shell-fish. At a small dis-
tance is a very abundant copper mine, from which
much metal is extracted and carried to Europe ;
and it is of this, as well as of its excellent breed
of horses, its wine, oil, tallow, cow-hides, and
dried meats, that its commerce is composed ; send-
ing, as it does yearly, four or five vessels loaded
with these effects to Lima. Although it has mines
of the purest gold, yet these are but little worked.
The whole of the town is covered with beautiful
myrtles, and of these there is a delightful grove.
It was destroyed by the Araucanos Indians in
1547 ; and in 1579 it was attempted to be taken by
Francis Drake, who was repulsed by the inhabi-
tants, la 1680 it seemed to be rebuilt only that
it might undergo a sacking the same year by the
English pirate, Bartholomew Sharps. Its popula-
tion consists of 500 families of Spaniards and
people of colour, and some Indians. Fifteen
