grand magnolias, palms, poplar, tilia, live-oaks,
&c. ; on the other side by extensive green plains
and meadows. The town consists of 30 habita-

of the same size, large, and convenient, and covered
close witli the bark of the cypress tree. Each has
a little garden spot, containing corn, beans, to-

plantation, which is worked and tended by the
whole community, yet every family has its parti-
