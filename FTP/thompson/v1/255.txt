==[[Campeche|CAMPECHE]]==, San Francisco de, a town of
the province and government of [[Yucatan]] in the
kingdom of [[Guatemala]], founded by the Captain
Francisco de Montejo, in the year 1540. It was
originally on the bank of a river, where at present
stands the settiement of Tenozic. It was afterwards
removed to the river Potonchan, more properly
called Cliampoton; and, lastly, it changed its
situation to the banks of tiie river San Francisco,
being notable for the convenience of its port, which
is one of the most frequented, and receiving more
merchandize than any other in the same gulf. The
city is small, defended by three towers, called La
Tuerza, San Roman, and San Francisco ; and these
are well provided with artillery. It has, besides,
a parish church, a convent of the order of San
Francisco, another of San Juan de Dios, in which
is the hospital bearing the title of Nuestra Serlora
de los Remedios ; and, outside of the city, another
temple dedicated to St. Roman ; to whom particu-
lar devotions are paid, and who is a patron saint.
In this temple there is held in reverence an image
of our Saviour, with the same title of San Roman,
which, according to a wonderful tradition, began,
previous to its being placed here, to eflect great
miracles ; accordingly, it is said, that a certain
merchant, named J uan Cano, being commissioned
to buy it in [[Nueva España]], in the year 1665,
brought it to this place, having made the voyage
from' the port of TeraCruz to the port of Cam-
peche in 24 hours. The devotion and confidence
manifested with regard to this elligy in this district
is truly surprising. There are also two shrines out
of the town, the one Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe,
and the other El Santo Nombre de Jesus, which
is the parish church of the Negroes. This town
has carried on a considerable commerce in the dye-
ing woods of Campeche, which it used to ship,
together with other articles, such as black wax
and cotton ; but this has greatly fallen off, on ac-
count of the distressing invasions that it has ex-
perienced, The first of these was by the English,
who took and sacked it in the year 1659; after-
wards by the pirate Lewis Scott, in 1678; and
again b}'^ the Flibustiers, iti 1685, when the prin-
cipal fort was burnt ami destroyed. It afterwards
became a w'ood inhabited by birds and animals.
[In the Maya language, cam signifies serpent,
and peche the little insect (acarus), called by the
Spaniards garapala, which penetrates the skin, and
occasions a smart pain. Between Campeche and
