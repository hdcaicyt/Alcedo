==[[Caranga Sj A Province And Corregimiento Of
[[Peru]]|CARANGASj a province and corregimiento of
Peru]]==, bounded on the n. by the province of [[Pa]]-
cages, e. by Paria, s. by Lipes, and w. by Arica ;
it is 36 leagues in length, n. to s. and 30 in width
at the most. Its climate is extremely cold and
subject to winds, so that it produces no other fruits
than such as are found upon the sierra. It has
considerable breeds of cattle both of the large and
small kind, huacanos^ sheep peculiar to the country,
called llamas, and no small quantity of vicunas ;
also in that part which borders upon the province
of Pacages are some herds of swine. Its silver
mines are much worked, and of these the most
esteemed is that called Turco, in which is found
the metal mazizo. Towards the w. are some un-
peopled sandy plains, in which pieces of silver are
frequently found, commonly called of these,

lumps have been picked of such a size as to weigh
150 marks. It is watered by some streams, but by
no considerable rivers ; the corregidor used here
to have a repartimiento of 340,526 dollars, and it
used to pay annually 436 dollars for alcavala. The
inhabitants, who are almost all Indians, amount
• to 1100, ajid they are divided into 25 settlements.
The capital is Tarapaca, and the others are.

said province, having formerly been its capital,
where were kept the royal coffers, and where the

annexed to the curacy of Huachacalla.

nity is a settlement called Carangui, distant 23
leagues s. of the town of Ibarra.

[==[[Carankouas|CARANKOUAS]]==, Indians of N. America, who
live on an island or peninsula in the bay of St.
Bernard, in length about 10 miles, and five in
breadth ; the soil here is extremely rich and plea-
sant ; on one side of which there is a high bluff, or
mountain of coal, which has been on fire for many
years, affording always a light at night, and a
strong thick smoke by day, by which vessels are
sometimes deceived and lost on the shoally coast,
which shoals are said to extend nearly out of sight
of land. From this burning coal, there is emitted
a gummy substance the Spaniards call cheta, which
is thrown on the shore by the surf, and collected by
them in considerable quantities, which they are
fond of chewing; it has the appearance and con-
sistence of pitch, of a strong, aromatic, and not
disagreeable smell. These Indians are irreconcile-
able enemies to the Spaniards, always at war with
them, and kill them whenever they can. The
Spaniards call them cannibals, but the French give
them a different character, who have always been
treated kindly by them since Mons. de Salle and
his party were in their neighbourhood. They are
said to be 500 men strong, but we have not been
able to estimate their numbers from any very accu-
rate information. They speak the Attakapo lan-
guage ; are friendly and kind to all other Indians,
and, we presume, are much like all others, notwith-
standing what the Spaniards say of them.]
