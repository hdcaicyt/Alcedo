==[[Hiaps hopeless tmderlakino;]]==. At the periocr Sir
George Staunton visited this country, a few Ita-
lian missionaries residing at Rio, he informs us,
took some pains to send among the Indians such
of their tribe who frequented Ahis city, as they
were enabled to gain over to their faith by pre-
sents, as well as by persuasion, in order by that
means to endeavour to convert the Indians scat-
tered throughout the country.

==[[No inquisition]]==, or tribunal of the holy office,
was ever legally established in the [[Brasil|Brazil]]s ; never-
theless the colonists are not wholly independent of
the power of that institution.

==[[In The Whole Of The [[Brasil|Brazil]]s|In the whole of the Brazils]]==, it is computed
that there are at least 600,000 slaves, who have
either been born in Africa, or descended from
those originally brought from that country. No
particular ordinance exists respecting these slaves,
though it is generally understood that they ought
to be tried by the common law. About 20,000
are annually imported to keep up the number.
The average price is about 301. sterling each.
Before being shipped from Africa, a duty of 10
reis per head used to be paid to the queen of
Portugalâ€™s agent in that country, and which in the
whole amounted to about 60,000/. a year. This
sum went to her own private purse, and was not
considered as a part of the public revenue. These
ill-fated beings are clothed and fed by their mas-
ters ; and a small portion of ground being al-
lotted to each, which they are allowed two days
out of the seven to cultivate for their own emolu-
ment, those among them who are laborious are
sometimes by this means enabled to purchase their
freedom, and which they have a right to demand
at a fixed price, whenever they find themselves
oppressed. To this circumstance it may perhaps
be owing that there are few fugitive Negroes in
Bmzil, and those few are chiefly to be found in
the vicinity of the mines, where they subsist on
the productions of the fields. This condition in
Brazil is hereditary through the mother, and is
not confined to colour, many of them exhibiting
every different shade from black to white. Those
belonging to the crown are chiefly employed in
the diamond mines, and other public works ; seve-
ral are also attached to the convents. The Bene-
dictines alone have more than 1000 on their dif-
ferent plantations. These fathers are of opinion
that the Mulattoes, or the offspring betw'cen blacks
and whites, arc generally endowed with much in-
telligence and ingenuity. Some of these children
they have educated and instructed with much care
and success ; and one of the friars, with great tri-

umph, mentioned to Sir George Staunton, during
his stay in [[Brasil|Brazil]], that a person of a mixed breed
had been lately promoted to a learned professor-
ship .at Lisbon.

==[[Such Of The Negroes|Such of the Negroes]]==, as well as the Mulattoes,
who have purchased their liberty, enjoy all tlie
rights of citizens, but they are excluded from the
priesthood, and from any civil employment under
government, nor can they hold a commission in
the army, except in their own battalions. The
colonists seldom or never marry a Negro woman,
confining themselves merely to forming with them
illicit connections, which are sanctioned by the
manners of the country.

==[[Had The Portuguese|Had the Portuguese]]==, instead of introducing
Negro slavery, and all its attendant train of evils,
into their new possessions, endeavoured, by a wise
and enlightened policy, to conciliate the good will
of the natives ; had they endeavoured to overcome
their natural indolence, by introducing among
them a taste for the conveniences of civilized life ;
had they, in short, endeavoured to render them
and the colonists but as one people, then would
their presence have proved a blessing to one of the
finest portions of the globe. But such was the in-
humanity and impolicy of these conquerors of the
new world, that no sooner had they gained a se-
cure footing in [[Brasil|Brazil]], than they seized upon the
Indians, whom they sold in the public markets,
and compelled to work like slaves on the different
plantations.

==[[In 1570]]==, Sebastian prohibited any [[Brasil|Brazil]]ian
from being subjected to slavery, except those who
were taken prisoners in a just war ; but this wise
regulation was evaded by the Portuguese, who
were too indolent to till the lands themselves, and
Avho had, besides, attached some idea of disgrace
to this species of labour ; and at this period a suf-
ficient number of Africans had not been imported
to answer the demand for cultivators.

==[[An Edict Of Philip Ii|An edict of Philip II]]==. in 1595, which con-
firmed the above orders, and likewise reduced
the term of slavery, in the case of prisoners, to 10
years, was equally disregarded by the colonists.

==[[In 1605 and 1609]]==, orders were again sent from
Europe, which declared the freedom of the In-
dians ; and Philip HI. having some time after
learned that this law had been in a -great measure
disregarded, issued an edict,, by w hich those who
infringed it in future should be subjected to heavy
penalties. But as these edicts were not more
respected than the former, the missionaries be-
came loud in their complaints respecting the op-
pression to which the Indian converts were sub-}
