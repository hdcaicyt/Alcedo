from which they are enabled to make sugar. It is
intersected by three rivers, which are of no use
whatever to it, being too low in their beds ; but they
unite and form the Pachachaca, which enters the
province of [[Abancay]], and has more than 40 bridges
of wood and cord thrown over it in different parts.
There are innumerable veins of gold and silver ore
in this province, which are not worked, from the
want of energy, and from the poverty existing
among the inhabitants ; and thus only some tri-
fling emoluraeul is now and then derived from one
or the other. It was otherwise in former times,
but these mines are now almost all filled with water.
Some mines of quicksilver have been discovered,
but the working of them has been forbid. Here
is little of the cattle kind, and no cloth manufac-
tures peculiar to the country arc made here, with
the exception of a sort of thick quilt, which they
call Chuces ; and a kind of grain is gathered here,
known by the name of Maino. This province was
united to the empire of [[Peru]] by Capac Yupan-
qui V. Emperor of the Incas. The language of the
natives is the same as that which is most universal
throughout the kingdom. The capital formerly
consisted of a large and w ell ordered settlement,
which was called Tintay, but which is at present
but thinly inhabited, on account of the scarcity of
water, and from a plague, in which almost all its
inhabitants perished. The number of souls in the
whole of the province may amount to 15,000. It
eontains 50 settlements within its jurisdiction. The
yearly tribute received by the corregidor used to
amount to 800,100 dollars, and the duties paid
upon the alcavahif (a centage on goods sold), to
688 dollars.
