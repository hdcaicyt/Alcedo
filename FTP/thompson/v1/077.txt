==[[Almost all enjoy a benign temperature]]==, and the
cold of winter is unknown to them. The fields
preserve an everlasting verdure, and the soil is
fertile in every kind of production, particularly
in sugar, brandy, cotton, ginger, indigo, coffee,
and tobacco ; these being the principal branches
of commerce. Besides the above-mentioned islands,
are those of Anegada, Sombrero, Saba, Grana-
dilla, and others much smaller, which are, more
properly speaking, little isles or rocks. At the
time of their discovery they were peopled by In-
dian Charibbes, rvho are cannibals of a very fierce
nature; a few of whom still keep possession of
some of the smaller isles. The Europeans esta-
blished themselves in them in 1625, after that the
Spaniards had kept in their possession some of the
principal of them from the time they were first
discovered. They have since been colonized by
the English, French, Dutch, and Danish, and
numbers of Negroes have been brought from the
coast of [[Africa]] to labour in them ; these latter
forming the greater part of their population.
Although the vine has been brought hither, the
wine produced from it is not found to keep.
These islands are extremely subject to violent
hurricanes, and it is seldom that five years elapse
without some deplorable calamity taking place.

[==[[The whole of the lesser islands]]==, with the ex-
ception of St. Bartholomew, which still belongs to
Sweden, and Margarita to Spain, have fallen into
the hands of the English. See West Indies,
also each island under its respective head.]

==[[Antioqui^|ANTIOQUI^]]==, the province and government
of the new kingdom of [[Granada]], one of those which
are called Equinocciales, from their being close
upon the line, bounded n. by the province of [[Car]]-
tagena, s. by Popayan, e. by the jurisdiction of
Santa Fe, and ic. by the government of [[Choco]].
It was called, in the time of the Indians, Hebex-
ico, and was discovered and conquered in 1541
by the brigadier George Robledo. It is of a
benign and mild temperature, abounding in pro-
ductions and in gold mines, from which it derives
its source of commerce. It has also some mines
of hyacinths, granite, and rock-crystal ; but they
are little wrought, from the scarcity of workmen.
