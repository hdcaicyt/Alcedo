Beyond the 18th degree of latitude the whole
country is a plain eminently fertile in wheat,
maize, agaxe^ and fruit trees. This plain is from
1800 to 2000 metres, or 5905 to 6561 feet, above
the level of the ocean. In this intendancy is also
the most elevated mountain of all New Spain, the
Popocatepetl. This volcano, first measured by
Humboldt, is continually burning ; but for these
several centuries it has thrown nothing up from its
crater but smoke and ashes. This mountain is
600 metres, or 1968 feet, higher than the most
elevated summit of the old continent. From the
isthmus of Panama to Bering’s straits, which
separate Asia from America, we know only of
one mountain, Mont St. Elie, higher than the
great volcano of Puebla.

==[[The Population Of This Intendancy Is Still More

Of Mexico|The population of this intendancy is still more

extends from the eastern declivity of the snowy
mountains to the environs of Perote, especially on
the high and beautiful plains between Cholula, La
Puebla, and Tlascala. Almost the whole country,
from the central table-land towards San Luis and
Ygualapa, near the S. sea coast, is desert, though
well adapted for the cultivation of sugar, cotton,
and the other precious productions of the tropics.

==[[The Table Land Of La Puebla Exhibits Remark 
Able Vestiges Of Ancient Mexican Civilization|The table-land of La Puebla exhibits remark-
able vestiges of ancient Mexican civilization]]==. The
fortifications of Tlaxcala are of a construction
posterior to that of the great pyramid of Cholula,
a curious monument, of which Humboldt promises
to give a minute description in the h istorical account
of his travels in the interior of the new continent. It
is sufficient to state here, that this pyramid, on the
top of which he made a great number of astrono-
mical observations, consists of four stages ; that in
its present state the perpendicular elevation is only
54 metres, or 177 feet ; and the horizontal breadth
of the base, 439 metres, or 1423 feet ; that its
sides are very exactly in the direction of the meri-
dians and parallels ; and that it is constructed (if
we may judge from the perforation made a few
years ago in the w. side) of alternate strata of brick
and clay. These data are sufficient for our recog-
nising in the construction of this edifice the same
model observed in the form of the pyramids
of Teotihuacan, which that author also de-
scribes. They suffice also to prove the great
analogy between these brick monuments, erect-
ed by the most ancient inhabitants of Anahuac,

the temple of Belus at Babylon, and the pyra*
mids of Menschich-Dashour, near Sakhara in
Egypt.

==[[The Platform Of The Truncated Pyramid Of Cho 
Lula Has A Surface Of 4200 Square Metres|The platform of the truncated pyramid of Cho-
lula has a surface of 4200 square metres]]==, or 45,208
square feet English. In the midst of it there is a
church dedicated to Nuestra Senora de los Reme-
dios, surrounded with cypress, in which mass is
celebrated every morning by an ecclesiastic of In-
dian extraction, whose habitual abode is the sum-
mit of this monument. It is from this platform
that we enjoy the delicious and majestic view
of the Volcan de la Puebla, the Pic d’Orizaba,
and the small cordillera of Matlacueye, which
formerly separated the territory of the Cholulans
from that of the Tlaxcaltec republicans.

==[[The pyramid]]==, or teocalli of Cholula, is exactly
of the same height as the Tonatiuh Itzaqual of
Teotiuhacan, already adverted to ; and it is three
metres, or 9.8 feet, higher than the Mycerinus, or
the third of the great Egyptian pyramids of the
group of Ghize. As to the apparent length of its
base, it exceeds that of all the edifices of the same
description hitherto found by travellers in the old
continent, and is almost the double of the great
pyramid known by the name of Cheops. Those who
wish to form a clear idea of the great mass of this
Mexican monument, from a comparison with objects
more generally known, may imagine a square, four
times the dimensions of the Place V^endorae, co-
vered with a heap of bricks of twice the elevation
of the Louvre ! The whole of the interior of the
pyramid of Cholula is not, perhaps, composed of
brick. These bricks, as was suspected by a cele-
brated antiquary at Rome, M. Zoega, probably
formed merely an incrustation of ahehpofstones and
lime, like many of the pyramids of Sakhara, visited
by Pocok, and more recently by M. Grobert. Yet
the road from Puebla to Mecameca, carried across
a part of the first stage of the teocalli, does not
agree with this supposition. We know not the
ancient height of this extraordinary monument.
In its present state, the length of its base is
to its perpendicular height as eight to one, white
in the three great pyramids of Ghize, this propor-
tion is as one and six-tenths and one and seven-
tenths to one, or nearly as eight to five.
