[==[[Big Bone Creek|BIG Bone Creek]]==, in Woodford counfy,
Kentucky, falls into the Ohio from the e. in about
lat. 38*^ 29' n. long. 84° 33' w. It is very small in
size, and has three branches ; the north-western -
most interlocks with Bank Lick creek, which falls
into Licking river. It is only noticeable for the
large bones and salt licks near it.]

[==[[Big Bone Licks|Big Bone Licks]]==, The, lie on each side of tlie
abovementioned creek, a little below the junction
of the two e. branches, about 8 miles from the
mouth of the creek. These, as also the other salt
springs in the w. country are called lichs, because
the earth about them is furrowed up in a most cu-
rious manner by the buffaloes and deer which lick
the earth, on account of the saline particles with
which it is impregnated. A stream ofbrackisli
water runs through these licks, the soil of which
is a soft clay. The large bones found here, and in
several other places near Salt licks, and in low soft
grounds, thought to belong to the mammoth, still
puzzle the most learned naturalists to determine to
what animal they have belonged. A thigli-bone
found here by Gen. Parsons measured 49 inches
in length. A tooth of this animal is deposited in
Yale college. Bones of a similar kind have been
found in other parts of America. A skeleton,
nearly complete, and above 11 feet high, which
was found near Hudson’s river, was brought to
England some years ago ; and anotlier of nearly
the same size is preserved in the college of New
Jersey. Of this animal the natives have no tra-
dition, but what is so fabulous that no conjecture
can be aided by it, except that the animal was
carnivorous ; and this is the general opinion, and
was admitted by the late Dr. Hunter of London,
from an examination of the tusks, &c.]
