appointed to tlie government of [[[[Brasil|Brazil]]]], where the
memory of his predecessor and grandfather, the
Count of Castlemayor, caused him to be received
with great expectations ; but these were soon frus-
trated by the disturbances at Pernambuco, the in-
vasion of Rio Janeiro by the French, and the tak-
ing of Bahia; which unlucky circumstances made
him earnest in his entreaties to the king to appoint
a successor : his request was complied with.

j 9. Don Pedro Antonio de Norona, Marquis of
Angeja, counsellor of state, and inspector-general
of the royal estates : he had from a very early
age an eye to the viceroyalty of India ; and ac-
tually entered it with the title of viceroy, in 1714 ;
his government was marked by the most prudent
regulations, and lasted until 1718.

40. Don Sancho de Faro, Count of Vimeiro, of
the royal house of Braganza, by the male line :
he served in the wars of this country, and was
master of the horse to her most serene highness
the Queen Maria Ana of Austria ; was go-
vernor of Mazagaii and of the province of [[Miho]],
when he was nominated captain-general of [[Brasil|Brazil]]
in 1718; where he however shewed more zeal
than fortune in his undertakings, and in little more
than a year terminated his career, leaving the go-
vernment to the charge of the archbishop, Don 8e-
bastian Monteiro da Vide, to the brigadier-gene-
ral, Don Juan de Araujo y Accevedo, and to the
oidor, Don Cayelano Brito de Figueredo, who
conjointly governed until the year 1720, when ar-
rived the right successor,

41. Don Vasco Fernandez Cesar de Meneses,
son of Don Luis Vasco Cesar de Meneses, and
nephew of John of Lancaster, both of whom had
governed in [[Brasil|Brazil]]: he was distinguished by his
conduct in war, and was thought deserving of be-
ing appointed by the king to the viceroyalty of
India, and was destined to govern Brazil in 1720 ;
when, by his nice discernment and well-regulated
plans, he nearly eclipsed all those who had gone
before him, and governed until 1724. The suc-
ceeding governors were as follows :
