these being the principal sources of trade in this
province ; and altJiougli it is not M'itliout a sufli-
cient quantity of flax and hemp, yet of tliesc little
is made ; nor indeed docs the small attention
■which is paid to tlieir cultivation, warrant the ex-
pectation of any consitlerable emolument to be
derived from them. In the estates are 150 families
of Spaniards, and innumerable parties of Indians,
who assist in their cultivation. It abounds also
in large and small cattle, and its woods in hares,
rabbits, partridges, and other birds. It is water-
ed by several large rivers, from which not only
the estates, but also all the gardens of the greater
part of the settlements of its district, derive great
benefit. The Indians are much given to the cul-
tivation of cotton, of v/hich they make particu-
larly fine garments, and indeed they are natu-
rally very indusrious. Thirty leagues s. e. of
Mexico.

==[[Atuncanar|ATUNCANAR]]==, a settlement of the province
and corregimiento of [[Cuenca]] in the kingdom of
Quito. It is of an agreeable and healthy tempe-
rature, abounding in productions, especially in
sugar-canes and cochineal. In the time of the
Incas of [[Peru]], it was a very wealthy population,
having a temple dedicated to the sun, a palace
and a fort, of which the ruins still remain, at
the distance of two leagues towards the n. and
which is the most regular, capacious, and well
constructed of any in that kingdom. At the
entrance of this tort, and in the front, is a small
river, which runs close up to its w alls ; and on the
opposite side it is terminated by a moderately lofty
hill, and hemmed in by a strong Avail. Nearly in
the centre is a turret of an oval figure, which rises
on the interior of the wall to about tlie height
of two toises, and to six or eight on the exterior.
In the middle of it is a square inclosed by walls,
which, towards the part which looks into the
country, has all its angles touching the circum-
ference of the oval, without leaving any pass ; and
there is, intieed, nothing left on the other side

save a very narrow way. In the middle of the
square is a division forming two small apartments,
which have no communication with each other ;
and they are entered by a door placed al the side
opposite the division. In the sides which front the
country are small holes, which served as a watch-
ing place, and w here, to all appearance, a guard
used to be mounted. Close upon the exterior of
this oval runs the wall, to the extent of 40 toises on
the left hand, and 25 on the right. This wall
afterwards becomes doubled, forming dift'erent
irregular angles, and including a large space.
Close to the rocky place from which the river has
its source, is a gate or entrance, and near to this
runs a narrow pass, where two persons only can
go abreast ; and this pass, when it comes to the
opposite wall, turns about and leads to the tower,
being still of the same breadth, it afterwards
inclines rather towards the rocky ])lace, but at
length widening, forms an half plain before the
same tower. In this narrow pass, at the distance
of three feet from each other, are disposed Jiiches,
formed in the solid wall like sentry boxes, and in
another part of the wall are two gates, Avhich are
capable of admitting very large stores and accom-
modations for the lodging of the troops. The
interior space is formed into various compartments,
and from the height of the walls, the gates, and the
nice economy Avhich prevails, the whole fabric
seems evidently to have been the habitation of
some prince. All the walls are full of holes, and
there are many small stones of six or eight inches
long, and three or four broad, jetting out from their
sides, and which no doubt served as pegs, upon
Avhich the soldiers might hang up their arras.
The Avhole of the wall is very thick, having a fine
parapet and a deep ditch without, and a very
capacious terrace within ; and although there is a
way entirely round the top, it has only one en-
trance, namely, by means of a staircase close to
the oval tower, which, after rising some steps,
forms the main staircase for the toner itself. The
structure, as well of the walls as of the interior
buildings, is entirely of unequal stones of irregular
figure ; but these are so neatly and so firmly put
together, that it is scarcely possible to perceive
Avhere they are joined. Opposite this settlement,
the Inca Atahualpa conquered his brother Huascar,
and put to the sword 60,000 of his vassals. In
its district towards the e. is an estate called Bue-
ran.
