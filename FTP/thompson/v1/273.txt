==[[Exclusive Of The Expenccs For The Civil Establish 
Ment Of Lower Canada|Exclusive of the expenccs for the civil establish-
ment of Lower Canada]]==, which are chiefly de-
frayed by the province, the British government
is at considerable expence for the maintenance of
the English clergy, the distribution of presents to
the Indians, and the military force and fortifica-
tions requisite for the security of tiie colony.
The actual sum expended by Great Britain annu-
ally, on account of the two provinces, may be esti-
mated at about 500,000/. sterling. It must, how-
ever, be observed, that the expences of the colony
are always in a fluctuating state, in consequence of
the increase or diminution of the military force,
and the extraordinary repairs of fortifications.
The expences of the civil government in Upper
Canada are defrayed by direct taxes ; by duties
upon articles imported from the United States}
and a sum granted by the Lower province out of
certain duties. In Upper Canada, lands, houses,
and mills ; horses, cows, pigs, and olher property,
are valued, and taxed at the rate of Id. in the pound.
Wood-lands are valued at Is. per acre, and culti-
vated lands at 50s. per acre. A house with only
one chimney pays no tax, but with two it is charged
at the rate of 40/. per annum, though it may be
but a mere hovel. The inhabitants of Lower Ca-
nada pay no direct taxes, except for the repair of
roads, highways, paving streets, &c. and then
they have the choice of working themselves, or
sending one of their labourers with a horse and
cart, &c. The revenue is raised, as stated in the
table of receipts and expences. The French Ca-
nadians are very averse to taxation in a direct way,
and much opposition is always experienced from
the French members of the house of assembly,
whenever any proposition, however beneficial, may
be offered which involves a direct cess. The uti-
lity of turnpikes has often been agitated in the
provincial parliament, and though the country
would be greatIy*improved by the opening of new
roads and communications with distant settlements,
yet the measure has always been violently opposed
by the French party. The communication be-
tween Canada and the United States, by the way
of lake Champlain, is extremely difficult ; the roads
are execrable, and will never be improved until
turnpikes are established upon them. A very con-
siderable trade is carried on between the two coun-
tries, and would increase with the facility of com-
munication. The ignorance and obstinacy, how-’’
