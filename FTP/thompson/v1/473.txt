coarse trowsers, baizes, and blankets. Although it
is some years since this province has received any
mischief from the infidels who inhabit the moun-
tains of the Andes, yet it has regular advanced de-
tachments or guards stationed for the defence of the
frontiers, prepared against a recurrence of the evils

peopled, since it contains upAvards of 50,000 souls
and 33 settlements, the capital of Avhich has the
same name. Its repartimiento, or tribute, used to
amount to 226,730 dollars, and it used to pay an
alcavala of 1814 dollars per annum. The settle-
