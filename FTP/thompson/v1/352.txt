==[[Ciiaciiapoi As|CIIACIIAPOI AS]]==, a province and corregimiento
of [[Peru]] ; liounded e. and s. by the mountains of
the infidel Indians, n. w. by the provinces of
Luya and Chillaos, and w. by C.axaraarca. Its
greatest length is 38 leagues from n. w. to s. e. and
its breadth is nearly as great. Its temperatuse is
for the most part mild, though in some places ex-
ceedingly hot, and in others equally cold, since a
branch of the cordillera intersects it. Upon this
account also it abounds greatly in all productions,
such as wheat, maize, and other seeds, and in all
kinds of herbs and fruits. It produces a good pro-
portion of sugar ; but the principal sources of its
commerce are cotton and tobacco ; these produc-
tions belonging peculiarly to the district of [[Mayo]]-
bamba, three leagues distant to the s. e. and being
held in great estimation. The women spin cot-
ton, of which they manufacture canvass for the
sails of ships, also for bags : they spin likewise
another sort of delicate thread, of which they
make linen for garments ; the men employing
tliemselves in the looms and in the cultivation of
cotton and tobacco : of this they used to gather
yearly 600 measures, consisting of 200 mazos or
rollos each, each mazo being valued at one real.
At present less is cultivated, from the prohibition
of commerce, so that the settlement has become
much poorer, and the price of the cotton for mak-
ing sails is now at two reals per lb. ; thougli that
which is very fine, at a dollar. As there is no cur-
rent coin, the inhabitants make barters in kind for
the necessaries they want. Thus also they pay liieir
tributes, duties, and taxes ; and the treaties amongst
them for canvass and linen cloths are consequently
very large, the prices being regulated amongst
themselves. They cultivate coca, and with this
they supply some of the neighbouring provinces.
