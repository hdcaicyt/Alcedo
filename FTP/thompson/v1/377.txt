==[[Cherokee]]==, a large river of the above colony
and province, called also Hogohegee and Calla-
maco. It rises in the county of [[Augusta]], and takes
its name from a numerous nation of Indians ; runs
V). for many leagues, forming a curve, and enters
the Ohio near the fourches of the Mississippi. Near
to this river are some very large and fertile plains ;
and according to the account rendered by the In-
dians, there are, at the distance of 40 leagues from
the Chicazas nation, four islands, called Tahogale,
Kakick, Cochali, and Tali, inhabited by as many
other different nations of Indians. [Cherokee was
the ancient name of Tennessee river. The name of
Tennessee was formerly confined to the fourteenth
branch, which empties 15 mites above the mouth of
Clinch river, and 18 below Knoxville.]

==[[Cherokee]]==, the country of the Indians of the
nation of this name in North Carolina. It stands
w. as far as the Mississippi, and w. as far as the
confines of the Six Nations. It was ceded to the
English by the treaty of Westminster, in 1729.
[This celebrated Indian nation is now on the de-
cline. They reside in the n. parts of Georgia,
and the s. parts of the state of [[Tennessee]] ; having
the Apalachian or Cherokee mountains on the e.
■which separate them from North and South Caro-
lina, and Tennessee river on the n. and zt\ and the
Creek Indians on the s. The present line between
them and the state of Tennessee is not yet settled.
A line of experiment was drawn, in 1792, from
Clinch river across Ilolston to Chilhove mountain ;
but the Cherokee commissioners not appearing, it
is called a line of experiment. The complexion of
the Cherokees is brighter than that of the neigh-
bouring Indians. They are robust and well made,
and taller than many of their neighbours ; being
generally six feet high, a few are more, and some
less. Their women are tall, slender, and delicate.
The talents and morals of the Cherokees are L*eld
in great esteem. They were formerly a powerful
nation ; but by continual wars, in which it has been
their destiny lo be engaged with the n. In-
dian tribes, and with the whites, they are now re-

estimate their numbers at 2500 warriors. They
have 4o towns now inhabited.]

houses, and a Presbyterian church. There is an
academy here, which contained, in 1796, 50 or 60

The township is very large, and lies along the e.
side of Otsego lake, and its outlet to Adiqnatangie
creek. By the state census of 1796, it appears
that 629 of its inhabitants are electors. This set-
tlement sutlered severely from the Indians in the
late war.]

e. n. e. and s. s. between cape Charles, lat. 37°
13' and cape Henry, lat. 37°, in Virginia, 12 miles
wide, and it extends 70 miles to the ??. dividing
Virginia and Maryland. It is from 7 to IS miles
broad, and generally as much as 9 fathoms deep ;
affording many commodious harbours, and a sale

and these are generally along the c. side of the bay,
except a few solitary ones near the xo. shore. A
number of navigable rivers and other streams

fisheries of herring and shad. There are also ex-

swans, but is more particularly remarkable for a
species of wild duck, called camashac/c, whose
flesh is entirely free from any fishy taste, and is
admired by epicures for its richness and delicacy.
In a coinnierciul point of view, this bay is of im--
