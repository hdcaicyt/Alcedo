[==[[The Merchants Of Canada Are Almost Wholly Bri 
Tish : They Derive Their Resources From England|The merchants of Canada are almost wholly Bri-
tish : they derive their resources from England]]==,
and in general have established themselves upon
small capitals and large credits. This may perhaps,
in some measure, account for the numerous failures
that have taken place amongst them ; and it is posi-
tively asserted as a fact, that since the country has
been in our possession not more than five in
100 have paid their debts. A variety of causes,
no doubt, have contributed to this extraordinary
defalcation ; a tedious winter of six months, during
which no business can be carried on with Eu-
rope, while interest upon their European debts
is charged after a certain period, and continues
winter as well as summer, is certainly a great
drawback in mercantile concerns ; the long credit
also which the Canadian merchants are obliged
to give the country storekeepers, tends very con-
siderably to impede their remittances in due
season, unless the utmost regularity is main-
tained. The timber and staves, which are brought
into Canada from the states, are cut down in winter
or spring, and collected into large rafts on lake
Champlain, from whence they are floated down
the river Richlieu into the St. Lawrence, and de-
posited along the shores of Silleri and Wolfeâ€™s
cove, for an extent of more than five miles. There
they are sorted for the merchants, and then taken
into the ships which lie off the cove, or at the
wharfs at Quebec. Standard-staves of 5| feet
long, If inch thick, and 5 inches broad, sell
in Canada usually from 40/. to 50/. the 1200.
The freight is about the same amount. The
rafts when coming down the river exhibit a cu-
rious scene ; they have peveral little sheds or
huts erected with boards for the accommodation
of the rowers, whose number on large rafts fre-
quently consists of upwards of 100 or 150. The
men employed in this business are chiefly Ameri-
cans from the state of [[Vermont]] : they live upon
the rafts until they are separated for sale, when
they remove their huts to the shore, where they re-
side during the remainder of the season ; at the
end of which they return home. Several rafts of
timber, and scows laden with staves, flour, pork,
and pot-ash, arrive annually from Upper Canada
at Montreal and Quebec. The trade between the
Upper and Lower provinces has been important
only within a very few years. The rapid in-
crease of population and agriculture in the new
settlements of U pper Canada, has produced a large
surplus of those articles for exportation, and the
demand for them has risen in proportion.

==[[This statement affords an agreeable presage of]]==

the future prosperity and opulence of the Upper
province. Some persons consider Upper Canada
as the garden of America, subjected neither to tha
tedious freezing winters of Lower Canada, nor the
scorching summers of the more southern parts of
the continent of N. America. The principal incon-
veniences to which the Upper province is subject,
are the falls and rapids which impede the naviga-
tion of the St. Lawrence between Kingston and
Montreal, and its distance from any commercial or
shipping town from whence its productions may be
exported to Europe. These are, however, in some
measure removed, and a considerable abundance of
the surplus produce of that province is now for-
warded to Montreal and Quebec. If good roads
were made between the two provinces, regular
waggons might be established as in England, and
goods conveyed up the country with more security
and expedition than they can at present by Avater :
a more regular communication Avould be then
opened between the two seats of government, Avhich
would be the means of expediting the public busi-
ness, and facilitating the commerce of both coun-
tries. The manufactures of LoAver Canada are
carried on chiefly by individuals for tlieir OAvn do-
mestic use. A manufactory of iron Avas established
by the French at Three Rivers, soon after the set-
tlement of the country. That government, how-
ever, Avas never able to make it pay the expences
attending the work, and it fell into the hands of
individuals, Avho succeeded very little better. Tlie
iron ore Avas at one time supposed to be nearly ex-
hausted, but fresh veins having been discovered in
the vicinity of the forges, the Avorks are noAv in a
flourishing condition. Anotlier manufactory of
iron has been established of late in the seigniory of
Batiscan, about half-way between Quebec and
Three Rivers, on the n. shore. Large sums of
money have been expended in endeavouring to
bring these works to perfection ; but very Uttle]
