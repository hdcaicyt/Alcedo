There will not be a carrying place between New

Mohawk to Wood creek, one ; Oswego lalls, two ;
Chenessee falls, two ; so that there are but 2 1 miles
land carriage necessary, in order to convey com-
modities from a tract of country capable of main-
taining several millions of people. The famous
Chenessee flats lie on the borders of this river.
They arc about 20 miles long, and about four
wide; the soil is remarkably rich, quite clear of
trees, producing grass near 10 feet high. Tliese
flats are estimated to be worth 200,000/. as they
now lie. They arc mostly the property of the

[==[[Chepewas|CHEPEWAS]]==, of Leach Lake, Indians of
N. America, claiming the country on both sides of
the Mississippi, from the mouth of the Crow-wing
river to its source, and extending w. of the Missis-

sippi to the lands claimed by the Sioux, with
whom they still cop.tend for dominion. They
claim also, c. of the Mississippi, the country ex-
tending as far as lake Superior, including the
waters of the St. lamis. Tliis country is thickly
covered with timber generally, lies level, and
generally fertile, though a considerable propor-
tion of it is intersected and broken up by small
lakes, morasses, and small swamps, particularly
about the heads of the Mississipi and river St.
Louis. They do not cultivate, but live princi-
pally on the wild rice, which they procure in great
abundance on the borders of Leach lake and the
banks of the Mississipi. Their number has been
considerably reduced by W'ars and tlie small-pox.
Their trade is at its greatest extent.]

[==[[Chepewas]]==, of Red Lake, Indians of N. Ame-
rica, who claim the country about Red Lake and
Red Lake river, as far as the Red river of lake
Winnipie, beyond which last river they contend
with the Sioux for territory. This is a low level
country, and generally thickly covered with timber,
interrupted with many swamps and morasses. This,
as well as the other bands of Chepewas, are es-
teemed the best hunters in the ti. to. country ; but
from the long residence of this band in the country
they now inhabit, game is become scarce ; there-
fore their trade is supposed to be at its greatest ex-
tent. The Chepewas are a well-disposed people,
but excessively fond of spirituous liquors.]

[==[[Chepewas]]==, of River Pembena, Indians of N.
America, who formerly resided on the e. side of
the Mississippi, at Sand lake, but were induced by
the N. W. company to remove, a few years since,
to the river Pembena. They do not claim the
lands on which they hunt. Tiie country is level,
and the soil good. The w. side of the river is
pi incipally prumVs, or open plains ; on the e. side
there is a greater proportion of timber. Their
trade at present is a very valuable one, and will
probably increase for some years. They do not
cultivate, but live by hunting. They are well-
disposed towards the whites.]
