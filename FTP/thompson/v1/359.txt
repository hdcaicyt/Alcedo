of it is a mountainous and rugged country, abound-
ing in. noxious animals and insects, and on this
account uninhabitable in the summer and in the
rainy season. It was conquered by Don Juan de
Ibarra in 1554, has many mines of silver and gold,
which were formerly worked, but which at present
are all abandoned, as well from their having filled
with water, as from the scantiness of the means of
the inhabitants to work them. The royal mines,
however, are productive of some emolument, and
are in fafct the support of the place. It produces
some maize, and much tobacco , and cotton, to
which article the soil is exactly suited, though not
so to wheat, which yields here but sparingly. On
the banks of the lakes formed by the sea, is left a
thick incrustation of salt in the month of April ;
and although the inhabitants spare no pains to col-
lect this valuable commodity, yet abundance of it
is lost from the Avant of hands to collect it ere the
heats come on, when it very quickly disappears.

for the working of the mines. The same river enters
the sea two leagues from the settlement of Chamet-
lan, and has abundance of fish, which are caught
