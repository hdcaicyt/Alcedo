==[[Buenos Ayres|BUENOS AYRES]]==.

[==[[The Population In Azara’s Table Of Paraguay|The population in Azara’s table of Paraguay]]==,
of the above date, is enumerated at 97,480 souls ;
and the total population of the vice-royally of La
Plata, 1803, appears, from the authority of the
same author, and of Alvear dc Ponce, to have
amounted to 972,000 souls.

5. Prese?U state.— In June 1806, a British expe-
dition entered the waters of the Plata, and took
possession of the capital on the 27tli of the same
month. The circumstances attending it are so fresh
in the minds of "the public that it is unnecessary
for us to dwell upon them further than to record,
that it gave rise to the famous trial of General
Whitelock. Tlie succeedins; history of this place
Avill be found under the article La Plata: suffice
it to observe for the present, that Buenos Ayres is
a city, of all others in America, rising into notice ;
and tliat it is daily the scene of great warfare and
disquiet, owing to the separate interests of the old
regime, or Spanish government, and of the provin-
cial junta, installed on the 26th August 1808, and,
as it is said, amidst the general acclamation of the
inhabitants. Long. 58° 26'. Lat. 34°S9.]
