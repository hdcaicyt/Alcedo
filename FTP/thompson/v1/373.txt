cattle of all sorts; aiul there arc some gold mines,
though they produce at present very sp:n ingly;
some of the silver mines, Avhlch were very fruitful,
have lately filled with water, and attempts have
been made in vain to empty them. Indeed the
only mines which have produced any great wealth
are those found in the mountains of Aullagas, and
from them, for some years past, metals of the
rarest qualities have been extracted. In the woods
of the valleys, which produce very fine and excel-
lent timber, are found wolves, tigers, and other
wild beasts inhabiting the mountains ; also a
species of bees, which form their combs in the hol-
lows of trees, and the honey of which they call
de charas. There is a river in this province com-
posed of several streams, and which unites itself
with the Cochabamba. The number of its inha-
bitants amounts to 36,000, who are divided into
27 settlements. Its reparlimienfo used to amount
to 92,665 dollars, and its n/cflxvife to 7-11 dollars
per annum. It is one of the richest provinces of
[[Peru]].
