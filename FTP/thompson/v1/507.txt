==[[Connecticut|CONNECTICUT]]==, a county of the province
and colony of [[New]] England in N. America. It is
bounded w. by New York and the river Hudson ;
is separated from the large island by an arm of the
sea to the s. ; has to the e. Rhode island, with part
of the colony of Massachusetts, and the other part
of the same colony to the n. It is traversed by a
river of the same name, which is the largest of the
whole province, and navigable by large vessels for
40 miles. This province abounds in wood, tur-
pentine, and resins ; in the collecting of which
numbers of the inhabitants are occupied, although
the greater part of them are employed in fishing,
and in hewing timber for the building of vessels
and other useful purposes. The merchants of the
province once sent to King Charles II. some tim-
ber or trees, of so fine a growth as to serve for
masts of ships of the largest burthen. The great
trade of woods and timbers carried on by means
of the river has much increased its navigation.
This territory is not without its mines of metal,
such as lead, iron, and copper: the first of these
have yielded some emolument, but the others
have never yet produced any thing considerable,
notwithstanding the repeated attempts which have
been made to work them. This county is well
peopled and flourishing, since it numbers upwards
of 40,000 souls, notwithstanding the devastations
that it has suftered through the French, the In-
dians, and the pirates, in the reign of Queen Anne,
when all the fishing vessels were destroyed.
When this colony was first founded, many great
privileges were given it, which have always been
maintained by the English governor, through
the fidelity which it manifested in not joining
the insurrection of the province of [[Massachusetts]],
until, in the last war, it was separated from the
metropolis, as is seen in the article U n ited States
OF America.
