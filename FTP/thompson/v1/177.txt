==[[Boston|BOSTON]]==, a large and opulent city, the me-
tropolis of New England, and of the county of
Suffolk, in N. America. In the year 1774, its
port was prohibited by an act of parliament of
Great Britain, and it was shortly after entered by
the kingâ€™s troops, who destroyed many edifices,
and caused considerable havoc. It was at that
time the largest and most considerable city of any
of New England, having been founded in 1630,
by the English colonists w'ho came to it from
Charlestown, in a peninsula of nearly four miles
in circumference, and 44 from the bay of Massa-
chusetts. It suffered much from an earthquake
which took place on the 29th October 1727. It is
the best situated for commerce of any city in
America ; on the n. side of it arc two small islands
called Brewster, to one of which is also given the
name of Noddle. The only entrance to the bay is
through a channel so narrow, from the number of
islands, as scarcely to admit three ships a-breast.
There arc, however, marks and buoys placed so
as to ensure a safe entrance, and the bay itself
is capable of containing 500 vessels, in a sufficient
depth of water, where they might formerly lie
defended by the cannon of a regular fortress, but
this was destroyed in the said war. At the ex-
tremity of the bay is a quay 2000 feet in length,
which on the n. part has a set of regular maga-
zines, beginning from the principal street in the
City ; this street, as rvcll as all the others, is spa-
cious and straight. The town from the bay has a
beautiful appearance ; it is in the form of an am-
phitheatre, with a house for the magistrate, in
which are the tribunals, and a change, which is a
very fine piece of architecture, surrounded
many libraries, well provided, and giving work
tor five printing houses. It contains 19 churches,

nearly 6000 houses, and 30,000 inhabitants. To
form some judgment of the riches of this capital, it is
sufficient to know, that from Christmas in the year
1747 to the following, 1748, no less than 500
vessels left its port, and that 430 entered it, not
to mention the fishing vessels and coasters, the
number of which alone amounted to at le.ast 1000.
It suffered much in 1773 by a terrible tempest.
The commerce of this city is very great, not only
on account of its own productions, but with re-
gard to the productions of other parts, since its
inhabitants are, as it were, the factors of all the
other colonies of N. America, the E. Indies,
and of some parts of Europe. Its principal ar-
ticles or effects are trees and ship-masts, fish, tar,
turpentine, planks, salted meats, as well pork as
beef, butter, cheese, horses, large cattle, wheat,
cider, honey, and flax ; and although it trades
also in skins, yet these form no considerable part
of its commerce. On its coast are large whale-
fisheries, in which a great number of its inhabi-
tants are employed ; and it is computed that 30,000
quintals of oil are annually sent to Italy, Spain,
England, and the islands of America, as also
20,000 more to the Negroes of the W. Indies.
The excessive quantity of liquors distilled in Bos-
ton from molasses, received in exchange or barter
from the W. Indies, is such as to cause them to
be sold for two shillings a barrel, and with them
arc supplied all the colonies of N. America. They
are also sufficient for the traffic with the Indians,
for that of the fisheries of Newfoundland, and for
a great part of the trade to Africa. The rum is as
much renowned for its plentifulness and cheap-
ness as for its quality. This may be looked upon
as almost the only colony that has manufactures
equal to its consumption. The cloths made here
are strong and close wove: these manufactories
were established by some Irish Presbyterians,
who fled from j'crsecution, and through afiinity of
religion, settled here, introducing the manufac-
ture of linens of a very delicate texture ; thus
having highly increased the commercial credit
and reputation of the colony. They likewise
make excellent hats here, and these, although
contraband, arc a great article of exportation to the
other colonies. The vessels built here, through
the commission of its dock, and which are after-
Avardssold with their cargo in the ports of Spain,
France, and Portugal, formed the principal source
of its commerce. There used to be a light-house
on a rock for tlie direction of vessels in tlie night,
the which was destroyed with the fortifications in
the late war. 'I'liis war originated in this capital
in 1774, w hen the inhabitants burnt the tea which
