llio Naipi to Cartagena. The same way offers
the advantage of a very quick communication be-
tween Cadiz and Lima. Instead of dispatching
couriers by Cartagena, Santa Fe, and Quito, or
by Buenos Ayres and Mendoza, good quick-sail-
ing packet-boats might be sent from Cupica to
[[Peru]]. If this plan were carried into execution,
the viceroy of Lima would have no longer to wait
five or six months for the orders of his court. Be-
sides, the environs of the bay of Cupica abounds
with excellent timber fit to be carried to Lima.
We might almost say that the ground between
Cupica and the mouth of the Atrato is the only
part of all America in which the chain of the
Andes is entirely broken.]

[==[[Cura|CURA]]==, with the surname of St. Louis de, is
situate in a valley formed by mountains of a very
grotesque appearance ; those on the s. w. side are
capped with rocks. The valley is, however, fer-
tile, and covered with produce, but the greater
part of the property consists in animals. The
temperature is warm and dry ; the soil is a reddish
clay, which is extremely muddy in the rainy sea-
sons ; the water is not limpid, although it is whole-
some. The inhabitants are 4000, governed by
a cabildo. In the church is an image of our Lady
of Valencianosy the claim to which was long a
subject of dispute between the curate of Cura and
that of Sebastian de los Reynos ; and after a SO years
contest, it was ordered by the bishop Don Fran-
cisco de Ibarro to be returned to this place, when
it was received in a most triumphant manner. This
city is in lat. 10° 2' ; twenty-two leagues s. xo. of
Caracas, and eight leagues s. e, of the lake of

only island of any consideration possessed by the
Dutch in America. It was settled in 1527, by the
Emperor Charles V. as a property upon theliouse of
Juan de Ampues ; is fertile, and abounds in sugar
and tobacco, large and small cattle, also in very good
saline grounds, by which the other islands are pro-
vided : but its principal commerce is in a contra-
band trade carried on with the coasts of Tierra
Firme ; on which account its storehouses are filled
with articles of every description imaginable.
Formerly its ports were seldom without vessels of
Cartagena and Portobelo, which were employed
n the Negro trade, bringing home annually froiu
1000 to 15,000 Negroes, with various other ar-
ticles of merchandise, although this branch ofcom-
merce has, from the time that it was taken up by
the English, greatly declined. On the s. part of
