course it collects the ’waters of many other rivers,
it passes near the cities of Popaj'iin, Buga, Cali,
and Anserma ; from whence it is navigable until it
enters the large river of the Magdalena. It is very
narrow where it passes through the cities of Po-
payan and Antioquia, and forms the letter S, tak-
ing its course through rocks, which render its na-
vigation very dangerous. The Indians, however,
are so dexterous in guarding their canoes from
running against the rocks by paddles, that it is
very seldom indeed that any accident occurs to
them. They call this strait Las Mamas de Cara-
manta, from a city which was here of this name.
Many make this navigation for the purpose of
avoiding a round-about journey of many days, and
in a bad road through the mountains ; and it is
said that some have had the good fortune to dis-
cover a route by water free from all difficulties,
and that this was actually made by the pontificate
of the bishop of Popayan, Don Diego de Mon-
toy.
