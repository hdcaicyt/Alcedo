which was conquered and united to the empire by
Mayta Capac, fourth Emperor of the Incas, after
the famous battle and victory of Huallu against
the Collas Indians. It is tolerably well j, copied,
and of a cold climate. Its territory abounds in
excellent pastures, iti which there are great quan-
tities of cattle. In some parts, where the tempera-
ture is hot, there is found maize, cacao, and sugar-
cane. This country abountls in woods, and in

[==[[Church Creek Town|CHURCH Creek Town]]==, in Dorchester
county, Maryland, lies at the head of Church
creek, a branch of Hudson river, seven miles $.w.
from Cambridge.]

[==[[Church Hill|Church Hill]]==, a village in Queen Ann’s county,
Maryland, at tlie head of S. E. Creek, a branch of
Chester river, n. w. of Bridgetown, and n. e. of
Centreville eight miles, and 85 s. w. from Phila-
delphia. Lat. 39° 6' n. Long. 76° 10' a?.]

==[[Churchill|CHURCHILL]]==, a great river of New S. Wales,
one of tlie provinces of N. America, at the mouth
of which the English Hudson bay company have a
fort and establishment; situate in lat. 59° w. and
long. 94° 12' w. The commerce of this place is
great and lucrative, and on account of its great
distance entirely secure from any disturbance from
the French. In 1747 the number of castor-skins,
which were brought by 100 Indians to this spot in
their canoes, amounted to 20,000. Several other
kinds of skins were also brought from the n, by
200 other Indians ; some of whom came hither by
the river Seals, or Marine Wolves, 15 leagues to
the s. of the fort. To the n. of this fort there are
no castors, since there arc no woods where these
animals are found, though there are many other
woods Avhich abound in wolves, bears, foxes, buf-
faloes, and other animals whose skins are valuable.
Here are great quantities of shrubs or small trees,
planted by the factory, supplying timber ; but the
opposite side, of the river is most favourable to their
growth ; and at a still greater distance are found
large trees of various kinds. The company re-
siding in the fort is exposed to many risks, and
obliged to inhabit a rock surrounded by frosts and
snows for eight months in the year, being exposed
to all the winds and tempests. On account of the
deficiency of pasture, they maintain near the fac-

tory no more than four or five horses, and a bull
w ith two cows ; for the maintenance of which du-
ring the winter, fodder is brought from a fenny
bottom some miles distant from the river. Those
who have been hero allirm, that between this river
and the river Nelson there is, at a great distance
up the country, a communication or narrow pass
of land, by which these rivers are divided; and the
Indians who carry on this traffic, have dealings
with the English navigating the river Nelson or
Albany. [See New Britain.]

and from water being brought to them from a river
which runs at least a league’s distance from the
the settlement. In its district are several herds of
large cattle, which form the principal branch of
the commerce of the inhabitants : these consist of
80 families of Indians. In its limits are also found
