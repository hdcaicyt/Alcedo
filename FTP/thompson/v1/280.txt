==[[Canada|CANADA]]==.

[==[[In 1769]]==, and for several years subsequent, the
principal articles of export consisted of peltry,
lumber, oil, and fish, with a small quantity of gin-
seng and capillaire : these were shipped fiom Que-
bec, Labrador, and Gaspe. Within the last
twenty years new staples have arisen, which have
been exported to very large amounts, and promise
to enrich the country equally with the fur trade;
These articles are wheat, biscuit, and flour, pot
and pearl ashes ; which in 1807 amounted to one-
half the total exports of 1797. It must be allowed,
however, that considerable quantities of pot and
pearl ash are brought into Canada by the Americans
from the United States ; yet the clearing of the
lands in Upper Canada, and the back settlements
of the Lower Province, produce annually a much
greater quantity than what is obtained from the
States. The French Canadians, within these two
or three years, have begun to make ashes ; they
have seen the facility with which their brethren of
the United States clear their lands and pay their
expences ; and though late, yet are willing to pro-
fit by the example. Their poverty or parsimony
had prevented them from paying 20/. for a pot-ash
kettle, though they might, like the Americans, have
made the salts in smaller quantities, and with little
trouble or expence. But it requires a scries of
years to eftect a change in the sentiments or actions
of the French Habitans. The great demand for
wheat which prevailed in Great Britain, and ge-
nerallythroughout Europe, in 1793-4 and 5, gave a
sudden stimulus to the exertions of the Canadians,
who during those years exported considerable
quantities of wheat, as well as flour and biscuit.
The increased price given for those articles tempted
the inhabitants to continue as large a cultivation of
grain in the subsequent years ; but the demand de-
clining, they experienced a sensible reduction in
their exports, and a consequent curtailment of their
incomes. The following statement will exhibit the
fluctuating demand for wheat, biscuit, and flour,
from 1796 to 1808.

==[[The unsettled state of the market for the above
articles renders it necessary to establish some
other]]==, of a more permanent nature, which might
also be derived from agriculture, and would be the
means of enriching the mother country as well as
the colony. The only article which could effec-
tually supply this want is hemp, and that alone.

if cultivated to a sufficient extent, would be more
than adequate to meet the whole expence of the
imports. The quantity of wheat exported in 1802
was unusually great, being 1,010,033 bushels;
but in 1807 it had fallen to less than a fourth of
that quantity, and in 1808 to less than a fifth ;
yet the general aggregate of the exports has aug-
mented, as well as the number of ships and seamen.
The exportation of almost every other article in
1808 greatly exceeded that of the preceding year,
in consequence of the embargo in the United States.
The number of shipping that cleared out from
Quebec in 1808 amounted to 334, and were laden
principally with timber, pot-ash, pitch, tar, and
turpentine ; wheat, flax-seeds, staves, &c. The
tonnage was 70,275, and the number of seamen
3330. The greatest part of these vessels were
sent by government, the usual supplies from the
Baltic being in a great measure cut off^ by the war
with Russia and Denmark, and the importations
from the United States being totally stopped by
the embargo. The advantage, therefore, of Great
Britain deriving her supplies of hemp^ as well as
every other description of naval stores, from Ca-
nada, cannot for a moment be doubted. Even
in time of peace, they would encourage and en-
rich the British colonists, and the competition in
the market with the productions of the United
States, and the n. parts of Europe, would inevi-
tably tend to lessen the expences of our navy
and commercial marine. The account of the ex-
ports and imports of Canada for the year 1810,
will doubtlessly afford the highest gratification to
our readers, to see the great increase of the trade
of that colony. Amongst a variety of articles too
numerous to be here inserted, we have selected
the following ;
