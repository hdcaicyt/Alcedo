==[[America Called New South Wales|America called New South Wales]]==. Its territory
consists of a white dry sand, and it is covered with
small trees and shrubs. This island has a beauti-
ful appearance in the spring to those Avho discover
it after a voyage of three or four months, and after
having seen nothing but a multitude of mountains
covered with frost, which lie in the bay, and in the
strait of Hudson, and which are rocks petrified
with eternal ice. This island appears at that sea-
son as though it were one heap of verdure. The
air at the bottom of the bay, although in 51“ of hit.
and nearer to the sun than London, is excessively
cold for nine months, and extremely hot the remain-
ing three, save when the n. w. wind prevails. The
soil on the e. &lt;^s well as on the w. side produces all
kinds of grain and fruits of fine qualities, which
are cultivated on the shore of the river Rupert.

veins of metals, which manifest themselves very
plainly, although they have never yet been dug
out ; and in the wet seasons the clay or mud pits
render the roads impassable. It is watered by the
river which rises in the pool or lake of Valladolid,
and by which the crops of wheat, maize, lentils, and
the fruits peculiar to the place, are rendered fertile
and productive. This reduced jurisdiction belongs
to the Marquises of Valle, and is subject to the
Dukes of Terranova. Its population is reduced to
some ranchos.^ or meetings for the purpose of labour,
and to the capital, which has the same name, and
which contains a convent of the religious order of
St. Augustin, this being one of the first temples
built by the Spaniards in this kingdom, the present
dilapidated state of it bearing ample testimony to
its great antiquity. It contains 430 families of
Pirindas Indians, employed in labour and in the
cultivation of the land, and in making bread, which
is carried for the supply' of Valladolid, the neigh-
bouring ranchos and estates. It should also have
