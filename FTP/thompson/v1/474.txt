four or five times in the year ; which causes the
ground to be so parched, that it would be entirely
uninhabitable, were it not for the multitude of
streams with which it is intersected, and which
render the temperature mild and healthy. The
country for the most part consists of levels, covered
with green shrubs and trees, forming shady woods
of three or four leagues in extent. In these are
found the [[Brasil|Brazil]]-wood, ebony, &c. which serve as
an asylum for wild beasts, leopards and wild
boars, deer and rabbits, a variety of mountain cats,
coyotes, serpents and vipers. In the valleys are
found a multitude of quails, turtle-doves, pheasants,
cranes, parrots, macaws, much esteemed for the
beauty of their plumage, and with which the In-
dians adorn themselves, and an infinite variety of
other birds. The rivers, all of which descend from
the sierras of Topia, in the rainy season increase to
such a degree as to inundate the country for the
space of three or four leagues ; and generally re-
maining out for eight days at least, the Indians are
under the necessity of forming for themselves a
kind of terrace upon the branches of trees, by means
of planks and sods, where they make fires and dress
their food. There are many salt ponds, also mines
of silver, which are not worked for want of la-
bourers. This province was peopled by several
nations of Indians, who had their villages and huts
on the sides of rivers. They used to maintain them-
selves on maize, which they cultivated, afso on ca-
labashes, which are very sweet and savoury, French
beans, and a species of wild caroh plant, called by
them mesqnites, and which being ground, they
used to drink in water, after the manner of choco-
late. They had also another delicacy in the plant
called mezcalj which resembles the savila ; of this
there are several sorts, of which they make wine,
sweets, and vinegar ; of its tendrils thread, and of
its prickles needles. This country also abounds in
nopales, pitahayas, and other plants, including
many which are native to Europe. Alvar Nunez
Cabeza de Vaca was the first who discovered this
extensive province in his perigrination, after he had
suffered shipwreck in going from Florida to
Mexico ; and from his report of it, the viceroy
Bon Antonio de Mendoza was induced to send into
it some persons to discover more concerning it. In
1590 it was visited by the regulars of the com-
pany of Jesuits, who came hither to preach the
gospel. They succeeded in making proselytes
amongst the natives, and established a regular
mission, which was patronized by the Queen Dona
Margarita of Austria, wife of Philip III. ; she
having sent, for the promotion of the interests of

this* great object, and for the decorations of the
altars, &c. several valuable presents of jewels,
ornaments, and other precious articles. The
capital is the town of San Felipe and Santiago,
and the other settlements are,
