a due e. line to Verte bay ; and on the w. by a
line to run due n. from the main source of St.
Croix river in Passamaquoddy, to the high lands
which divide the streams that fall into the river
St. Lawrence and the bay of Fundy; and from
thence by the s. boundary of the colony of [[Quebec]],
until it touches the sea-shore at the w. extremity
of the bay of Chaleur ; then following the course
of the sea shore to the bay of Verte, (in the straits
of Northumberland), until it meets the termina-
tion of the e. line, produced from the source of
the Missiquash above-mentioned, including all the
islands within the said limits. The chief towns
are St. John’s, the capital, Fredericktown, St. An-
drew’s, and St. Ann, the present seat of govern-
ment. The principal rivers are St. John’s, Mage-
gadavick, or Eastern river, Dickwasset, St. Croix,
Merrimichi, Petitcodiac, and Memramcook; all,
the three last excepted, empty into Passamaquoddy
bay. St. John’s river opens a vast extent of fine
country, on w'hich are rich intervales and meadow
lands ; most of which are settled and under improve-
ment. The upland is in general well timbered.
The trees are pine and spruce, hemlock and hard
wood, principally beech, birch, maple, and some ash.
The pines on St. John’s river are the largest to be
met with in British America, and afford a con-
siderable supply of masts for the royal navy. The
rivers which fall into Passamaquoddy bay have
intervales and meadows on their banks, and must
formerly have been covered with a large growth of
timber, as the remains of large trunks are yet to be
seen. A raging fire passed through that country,
in a very dry season, according to Indian accounts,
about 50 years ago, and spread destruction to an
immense extent. For other particulars respecting
this province, see the articles separately, and
Nova Scotia, British America, &c.]

the stomach for promoting digestion are admirable,
and, indeed, it has been proved by experience to
be a fine thing for dispelling all crude humours,
and preserving the body in constant health. Close
to it the regulars of the company of Jesuits had a
