He also states the population in 1808 at 900,000
souls. The receipts of Caracas, Guatemala, and
Chile, are consumed within the country. The
population of some of the chief cities is thus stated ;
Caracas 40,000, La Guaira 6000, Puerto Cabello
7600, Coro 10,000. The harbour, or La Vela de
Coro, as it is commonly called, and its environs, are

three state prisoners were sent from Spain to Ca-
racas, on account of their revolutionary propensi-
ties. Being treated with great indulgence by the
officers and soldiers to whose care they were com-
mitted, they formed the project of a conspiracy
against the government. They engaged a number
of persons, some of them of consequence, in their
party. After gaining their first converts, the spirit
did not spread. The coldness and apathy of the
people did not admit of the effervescene they de-
sired. After the plot had been kept a secret for
many months it was disclosed to the government.
Some of the ringleaders escaped, and others were
taken. It was found that seventy-two had entered
into the conspiracy; six were executed. The
rest either escaped, or were sent to the galleys or
banished from the country. For an account of the
