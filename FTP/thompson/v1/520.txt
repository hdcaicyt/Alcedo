==[[Coro|CORO]]==, Santa Anade, a city of the province
and government of [[Venezuela]], thus named in the
time of the Indians, after the district called Coriana.
It was founded by Juan de Ampues in 1529.
The Weltzers, under the orders of Nicholas Fe-
derman, were the first Avho peopled it, giving it the
name of Cordoba, to distinguish it from the other
city of the same name which had been founded by
Gonzalo de Ocampo in the province of [[Cumana]],
This name it afterwards lost, and took that of
Coro, which it preserves to this day, from a small
settlement of Indians thus named. It is of a dry
and hot temperature, but so healthy that physicians
are said here to be of no use. The territory, al-
though sandy and lack of water, produces every
kind of vegetable production ; so that it may be
said to abound in every thing that luxury or con^
venience may require. Here are large breeds of
cow-cattle and goats, and a considerable number
of good mules. Its articles of merchandize, such
as cheese, tanned hides, and cacao, meet with a
ready sale in Cartagena, Caracas, and the island of
St. Domingo. It has a reduced convent of the re-
ligious order of St. Francis, and an hermitage
dedicated to St. Nicholas. The town is very rich.
It was plundered, by the English in 1567. Its
church was a cathedral, and the head of the
bishopric, from the time that it was erected in
1532 until 1636, when this title was transferred to
Santiago of Caracas. It is two leagues distant
from the sea, where there is a port insecure, but
much frequented by trading vessels.

[==[[From The Time That The Governor Began To Re 
Side At Caracas|From the time that the governor began to re-
side at Caracas]]==, in 1576, there remained no con-
spicuous authority at Coro but the bishop and
chapter, and they did all they could to follow th«
governor; and indeed, not being able to leave
Coro by legal measures, they put tlieir wishes
into effect by flight, in 1636. At three leagues
from the city are lands where they cultivate with
success, if not with abundance, all the usual pro-
duce of the country. The inhabitants, who are
much addicted to indolence, glory that they are
descended from the first conquerors of the country ;
and there is here, generally speaking, more rank
than wealth, and more idleness than industry. The
little trade that is carried on here consists in mules,
goats, hides, sheep-skins, cheeses, &c. which come
in a great measure from the interior, and the
larger part fromCarora; shipments of these ar-
ticles are made for the islands. The most common
intercourse is with Cura 9 oa, from whence they
