tcity on one side, and a horn-work on the other*
feetween these lay a piece of sjround coyered with
shrubs and bushes, where the Portuguese governor
had posted himself with 400' mem This dispo-
sition was attended with the most serious con-
sequences to the Dutch; for,- after an obstinate
engagement, attempting to retire by that way, they
were attacked in the rear,- and lost four officers of
distinction, besides their principal engineer, and
SOO of their best men; on which Count Maurice,
abandoning the post he had taken, raised the
siege with great precipitation. In the mean
time the Spanish government sent out, in the
beginning of 1640, Count de las Torres with
a fleet of large and small vessels, amounting
to 93 sail, having 12,000 men on board. Count
Maurice awaited his approach, with 41 men of
war, within four miles of the coast of [[Olinda]],
This last fleet was commanded, under the Count,
by Ad.miral Loos, a man of the most determined
courage and bravery.- These hostile fleets met
and engaged, on the 12th of January, near the
island of [[Tamaraca]], and after a contest which
lasted four days, the Dutch gained a complete
victory. But an event at this time occurred in
Europe, which completely changed the state of
affairs in [[Brasil|Brazil]].

==[[The Portuguese Had Never Been Thoroughly Sa 
Tisfied With Their Situation|The Portuguese had never been thoroughly sa-
tisfied with their situation]]==, nor enjoyed much pros-
perity since their subjugation to the Spanish yoke
in 1581. Philip II. it should appear, liad deemed
it better to reign over an enslaved nation than one
owing its allegiance to the affectiorr and good-will
of the people; and in almost every instance did
he sacrifice the glory of the Portuguese name to
those narrow and mistaken ideas of policy. This
prince had, however, the address to conceal his
real intentions under the most specious and honour-
able pretexts ; but his son, who pursued the same
pernicious maxims of government, suffered the
Portuguese to be deprived of a number of con-
quests which had been acquired at the expence of
much blood and treasure, and had proved to them
a source of glory, power, and riches. The suc-
cessor of this weak monarch, possessing still less
understanding than even his father, openly at-
tacked the administration, the laws, and privi-
leges of the Potuguese people ; and to this impoli-
tic conduct he is said to have been instigated by
the advice of Olivares, with a view to provoke a
revolt, that he might obtain over them the rights
of a conqueror.

11. King John IV. — A short time hoAvever
evinced how unwise had been his plans for these
repeated outrages ; for a conspiracy, which dur-

ing three y^ars had been organizing with uncom^
mon secrecy, and had united in one interest all the
Portuguese whom Spain had laboured to divide,
burst out with incredible fury in December 1640j
when Philip IV. was ignominiously expelled from
Portugal, and the Duke of Braganza, by title of
John IV. placed on the throne of his ancestors.
The example of the capital was soon followed by
the rest of the kingdom, as well as by what re-
mained of the colonies, settled under happier aus-
pices in Asia, Africa, and America. The new
king had scarcely ascended the throne before he
united his interest and resentments with those of
the English, the French, and, in short, with all
the enemies of Spain. On the 23d of June 1641,
he concluded an offensive and defensive alliance
with the United Provinces for Europe, and a 10
years truce for the East and West Indies. Prince
Maurice, who had foreseen that such an event
would naturally result from the changes which had
take place in Portugal, resolved to embrace the
present opportunity of regaining the captainship
of Segerippa, which had been wrested from him by
the Portuguese. lie also reduced the island of
Loanda, on the coast of [[Conga]], and that of St-
Thomas, which lies directly under the equinoctial
line ; after Avhich he dispatched Admiral Lich-
thart and Commodore Hanskins with six men of
war and an equal number of frigates, in order to
reduce the island of [[Mara]] nan and the town of St.
Lewis. Having effected this service, the rest of
the districts submitted of course, so that towards
the conclusion of the year 1641 the Dutch pos-
sessed seven out of the 14 captainships into which
[[Brasil|Brazil]] was divided. As most of these successes were
obtained after the publication of the truce above-
mentioned, a remonstrance was addressed to the
statcs-general by the Portuguese ambassador, re-
presenting in strong terms the unjustifiable nature
of such proceedings. Some of the jflaces in ques
tion they refused, under one specious pretence or
another, to relinquish; and though orders were
sent out for the delivering up others, these injunc-
tions were drawn up in such a vague manner, that
most of the Dutch governors in Brazil refused to
comply Avith them.

12. Ixcjined policy of the Porhtgiie^e . — While
these unjustifiable proceedings rendered the Portu-
guese more anxious than ever to expel the Dutch
wholly from [[Brasil|Brazil]], they had recourse to a most
wise and refined piece of policy, in order to for-
ward the accomplishment of their designs. They
magnified the Avisdom of the Dutch government,
apparently confided in their promises, and readily
acquiesced in the validity of the excuses Ayhichl
