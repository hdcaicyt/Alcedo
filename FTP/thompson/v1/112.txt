==[[Atoyaque]]==, another, with the dedicatory title
of La Concepcion, the head settlement of the dis-
trict of the alcaldia mayor of [[Tepozcolula]], in the
province and bishopric of Oaxaca in the same
kingdom. It is of a hot temperature, situate near
the large river of its name, which fertilizes the
greater part of the territory, and in it, at certain
seasons, trout are caught and carried to be sold
in the capital of the province, where they are
held in high estimation, their price varying in
proportion to their scarcity. It produces an infi-
nite quantity of cotton, the manufacture of which
is the principal source of commerce to the natives,
who consist of 29 families of Indians. Fifteen
leagues to the s. with a slight inclination to the w.
of its capital.

==[[Atrato|ATRATO]]==, a large and abundant river of the
province and government of [[Darien]] in the king-
dom of [[Tierra Firme]]. It has its origin and source
in the mountains of the province of [[Choco]], from
two lakes which form the rivers Quito and San
Pablo, which latter become immediately united.
It runs nearly straight from s. to n. for more than
95 leagues, and empties itself into the N. sea ;
collecting in its course the waters of the Tigre,
Torren, and Pequest, the waters of the lake

==[[Luina]]==, and several other streams of such magni-
tude as to cause it to form a mouth upwards of
five leagues broad, in the great bay or gulph
called Darien, near the limits which divide the
two governments and jurisdictions of Cartagena
and Parnana. This river, which in that country
is also known by the names of Darien and Choco,
is navigable for many leagues ; but its navigation
is prohibited on pain of death, without any ex-
ception whatever, in order to avoid any prejudice
which might arise to the provinces of the Nuevo
Reyno, by means of the facility with which this
kingdom might be thus entered. Neverthless the
viceroy of that kingdom, Don Manuel Guiriol,
proposed that this passage should be free and open,
though with the proper precautions against any
probable mischief. Its sands abound with gold.
Just at its entrance into the sea, are 17 small
islands lying in two lines. Its mouth is in lat. 8°
2' w.

and cattle.

==[[Atrisco|ATRISCO]]==, or Carrion, a capital town of
the alcaldia mayor and jurisdiction of its name
in [[Nueva España]]. It is very beautiful and large,
abounding in streams, which irrigate the whole
of its district and render it agreeable both in
appearance and fertility. It has two parishes,
one for the Spaniards and another for the Indians j
five convents of the religious orders of St. Fran-
ciscans, La Merced, San J uan de Dios, in which
there is a good hospital and building for con-
valescents, of barefooted Carmelites, and of the
nuns of Santa Clara ; diflferent chapels and her-
mitages in the wards, which are peopled by In-
dians, and of which the most extensive is that
called De los Solares, a small population living in
orchards and gardens which are filled with flowers,
fruits, and vegetables ; the same charming spot
being rendered fertile by diflferent streams encom-
passing it on all sides, and afl^ording refresh-
ment and recreation to the inhabitants of the ca-
pital, who amount to 400 families of Spaniards,
Mustees, and Mulattoes, (from whom three com-
panies of militia have been formed), and also to
1250 families of Mexican Indians. The valley
of Atrisco, celebrated for its beauty and fertility,
has cultivated estates which produce immense
abundance of wheat, maize, barley, and other
grains, by which other provinces are supplied,
