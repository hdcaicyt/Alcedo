==[[Bacallaos Islands|BACALLAOS Islands]]==, situate opposite the
coast of [[Newfoundland]], and surrounding- the Great
bank. They are small and numerous : discovered
by Sebastian Gabot, lie gave them this name from
the abundance of cod-fish caught on their coasts.
This fishery has employed yearly upwards of
400 vessels of different nations, and it is effected
by angling. The fish is accustomed to bite im-
mediately that the hook is dropped into the water,
and being hauled upon the ship’s deck, a person
stands ready to chop off its head ; another takes
out its intestines and bones it, after which it is salt-
ed and barrelled, and sent to all parts of the world.
This fishery can be carried on only in the day, as
the fish will not bite in the dark. It is also pecu-
liar to the spring season, and ends in September,
since in the winter these fish like the bottom of the
sea. Sometimes their abundance is wonderful,
and it has been said that a certain person, of the
name of Juan Poon, once caught 100 in the space
of an hour. These islands are 70 miles distant
from [[Tierra Firme]].
