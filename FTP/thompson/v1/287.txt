cannibals, inhabiting the islands of the Antilles

these Indians at the present day inhabiting those
islands ; the greater part are to be found in Domi-
nica, which is entirely possessed by them ; they
adore a man who they affirm Avas uncreated, and
the first of all men, who descended from heaven,
and was called Longuo, from whose navel Avere
born other men , and some also from his legs, Avhich
he himself cleft open with a hatchet. With the
Manicheans, they believe in the two original causes
of good and evil, and in the immortality of the
soul ; and whenever any one dies they bury with
him his slaves and servants, thinking they may
be of use to him in the other Avorld. They are
polygamists, very cruel, but dexterous in the use
of the bow and arrow ; they are to be found also
in other parts of the continent. [See Caribes.]
