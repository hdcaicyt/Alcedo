and government of [[Tnciiraan]], in the jurisdiction

[==[[Cfl Au Dl Ere River|CflAUDlERE River]]==, a s. e. water of the St.

ties, in the district of [[Maine]]. The carrying place
from boatable waters in it, to boatable Avaters in the
Ketmebeck, is only five miles.]

[==[[Chau Di Eit E Fails Are Situate About Nine Miles
Above Quebec|CHAUDiEitE Fails are situate about nine miles
above Quebec]]==, on the opposite shore, and about
three or four miles back from the river St. Law-
rence, into whicli the river Chaudiere disembogues
itself. The river is seen at a distance, emerging
from a thick Avood, and gradually expanding
from an almost imperceptible stream till it reaches
die cataract, Avhose breadth is upwards of 360
feet. Here the disordered masses of rock, which
iippear to have been rent from their bed by some
violent convulsion of nature, break the course of
the waters, and precipitate them from a height of
120 feet into an immense chasm below. In some
parts large sheets of Avater roll over the precipice,
and fall unbroken to the bottom ; Avhile in other
places the Avater dashes from one fragment of the
rock to another, Avith Avild impetuosity, belloAV-
ing and foaming with rage in every holloAV and
cavity that obstructs its progress ; from thence it
rushes down with the rapidity of lightning into
the boiling surge beneath, Avhere it rages Avith in-
conceivable fury, till driven from the gulf by
fresh columns, it hurries aAvay and loses itself in
the waters of tlie St. Lawrence. The scenery
Avhich accompanies the cataract of Chaudiere is
beautiful and romantic beyond description. In
the centre, a large fragment of rock, which first
divides the water, at the summit of the precipice,
forms a small island ; and a handsome fir-tree,
which groAvs upon it, is thus placed in a most
singular and picturesque situation. The forest on
either side the river consists of firs, pines, birch,
oak, ash, and a variety of other trees and shrubs,
intermingled in the most Avild and romantic man-
ner. Their dark green foliage, joined with the
broAvn and sombre tint of the rocky fragments over
which the Avater precipitates itself, form a strik-
ing and pleasing contrast to the snoAvy white-
ness of the foaming surge, and the columns of
sparkling spray which rise in clouds and mingle
Avilh the air.]
