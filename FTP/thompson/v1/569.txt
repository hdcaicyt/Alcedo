It flows down on the s. side of the skirt of the
mountain and volcano of Cotopacsi, and united
with the Alaques, forms the San Miguel, which
laves part of the llanura of Callo, runs near the
settlement of Mulahalo, and by a country seat and
estate of the Marquisses of Maenza, who have here
some very good cloth manufactories. This river
runs very rapid, and in 1766, owing to an erup-
tion of the volcano, it inundated the country,
doing infinite mischief; again it was, a second
time, thrown out of its bed, though the damage
it then did was nothing like what it was on the
former occasion.

==[[Cuyo|CUYO]]==, CuTto, or Cujo, a large province of
the kingdom of [[Chile]], and part of that which is
called Chile Oriental or Tramontano, from its
being on the other side of the cordillera of the
Andes; bounded e. by the country called Pampas ;
n. by the district of [[Rioxa]], in the province and
government of [[Tucuman]] ; s. by the lands of Ma-
gellan, or of the Patagonians ; and w. by the cordil-
lera of the, Andes, which is here called the West-
ern, Cismontana, part of those mountains. It is of
a benign and healthy climate ; and although in
the summer, the heat on the llanuras is rather op-
pressive, extremely fertile, and abounding, inde-
pendently of the fruits peculiar to the country, in
wheat, all kinds of pulse, wine, and brandies,
which were formerly carried to the provinces of
Tucuman and Buenos Ayres, although this traf-
fic has of late fallen into decay, from the Ifeqiyjnt
arrivals of vessels from Spain. It abounds in all
kinds of cattle, and in the cordillera., and even in
the pompc.s-, are large breeds vicunas, hi/a7/ncos,
vizcachas, turtles, two kinds of squirrels, ostriches,
tigers, leopards, and an infinite quantity of par-
tridges, pigeons, and turtle-doves. The flesh of
the swine and mules is esteemed the best in all
America; and, generally speaking, victuals are so
cheap that it may be procured at little or no ex-
pence. The skirts of the mountains are covered
with beautiful woods, and their tops are over-
spread with snow. Throughout nearly the whole
province is found a great quantity of glass-wort,
and in the cordillera are some miiies of silver, espe-
cially in the valley of Huspallata, which were
formerly wmrked by fusion, to the great detriment
of the metal, but which are to this day worked in
the same manner as those of [[Peru]], and conse-
quently afford greater emolument. Here are also
some gold mines, and others of very good copper.
Tile rivers which water this province all rise in
the cordillera, and the most considerable of them
are the Tunuyan, w hich is the first to the s. those
of Mendoza, San Juan, Jachal, and the Colorado
to the n. c. In the cordillera, near the high road
leading from Santiago to Mendoza, is the great
lake of the Inca, wherein are said to be great
treasures deposited by the Incas at the beginning
of the conquest, to keep them from the Spaniards.
This lake is bottomless, and it is thought to be
formed of the snows melted and flow'ing down
from the mountainous parts of the district. On
the side tow'ards Chile ilie lake has a vent by six
or seven small branches, forming the river of
Aconcagua ; and from the opposite side issue some
other streams in a contrary direction, and form
the iMendoza. In the very heat of summer this
