[==[[Andr Ci S Islands|ANDRCiS Islands]]==, sometimes called Holy
Ghost Islands, are of very considerable magnitude,
and have been very erroneously placed in almost
every map or chart of the Bahama islands. They
extend in a sort of curve, or crescent, upwards of
forty leagues in length. There is a passage be-
tween the northern point of them (at Joulter’s
keys) and the Berry islands, ofdifiicult navigation,
and not above eight feet deep. Vessels, therefore,
proceeding from that quarter to Cuba, should go
round the n. end of all the Berry islands, over the
Great Bahama bank; which, however, will (not
admit vessels drawing more than 12 feet. There
are also several passages, or creeks, (though very
shallow), through this chain of islands, particularly
towards the 5. extremity and Grassy Creek keys.
Upon the w. side of Andros islands is the most
71. extremity of the Great Bahama bank. On the
e. side there are no soundings at any considerable
distance from the shore. The most n, point of
the principal Andros island lies about 10 or 11
leagues zb. n. w. from the zv. end of New Provi-
dence. High Point, which is the mdst s. part of
it, lies about eight leagues s. from the Zi&gt;. end of the
same island. There are few, if any, inhabitants now
on Andros island. In the interior of the island, there
is a shallow swamp or lake of fresh water, almost
the only one which is to be found in the Bahama
islands ; and it communicates with the sea by a
creek, or lagoone, navigable for flat-bottomed
boats. Great quantities of various sorts of timber
abound in the interior ; but, from the shallowness of
the banks, and extreme difficulty of getting any
communication to the coast, the trees remain un-
touched. One part of Andros island extends to
the Z 0 . very far into the Great Bahama bank, in
a s. ZB. direction from New Providence, towards
Salt key and the island of [[Cuba]]. In 1788 An-
dros island contained about two hundred inhabi-
tants, including slaves; and previous to May
1803, lands were granted by the crown, to the
amount of 16,025 acres, for the purpose of culti-
vation. See Bahamas.]
