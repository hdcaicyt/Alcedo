of cattle, both of the larger and smaller kind. On
the mountains is found pit-coal, and some even
assert that there arc also mines of silver and other
metals, though to the present day we have never
heard of such mines having been worked. In the
uncultivated wastes of an immense extent, are
found beavers, and in the rivers and lakes every
kind of fish. Its principal lakes are Erie, Michi-
gan, Huron, SiiTjerior, Frontenac or Ontario,
Nipyslng, Tomiscaning, and many other of less
note ; but the largest of all is lake Superior, situ-
ate farther n. than the rest ; this is 100 leagues
in length, and 70 in breadth, and in it are various
islands, viz. Royal island, Philip, Pont, Chartrain,
Maurepas, St. Anne, St. Ignace, Tison, and many
smaller ones. All this extensive country is full of
the largest rivers, the enumeration of which would
be tedious : the two principal, however, are those
of St. Lawrence and Mississippi: the former of
these abounds in a profuse variety of excellent fish,
and receives various other rivers in its course.
The entrance of the bay of St. Lawrence is situate
between tlie cape Retag of the island of [[Newfound]]-
land, and N. cape of Royal island, or Cape Breton.
The Mississippi, which runs through the greatest
part of the province of [[Louisiana]] from n, to s. is
called by tlie French the river of St. Louis, and
by the natives Misehispi, Mississippi or Mescha-
gamisii, from its inundating vast tracts of land at
the time of its flushes. The French established
themselves in this province in the year 1335, under
the command of Jacob Cartier. They also com-
menced a commerce with the Indians, taking of
them hides in exchange for bnuidy, tobacco, pow-
der and shot, axes, and all kinds of iron tools ; and
for the proper conducting of this mercantile sys-
tem, a body of men were established, called run-
ners of the mountain, who, traversing in their
canoes the widest lakes and largest rivers, carry at
the present day, with incredible industry and pa-
tience, effects to the most distant inland and un-
known parts. These people brought their hides to
the fair of Montreal, which was held in June, when
large feasts were made, and guards established
under the directions and assistance of the governor,
for the maintenance of order ; a precaution most
necessary, when it is considered how many savage
nations were assembled, some coming from a thou-
sand miles distance. A trade is also carried on by
the canal, in as much as many stop with tlieir mer-
chandize at Albany in New York, where they pro-
cure the desired effects with more convenience
than at Montreal ; thus avoiding the lalx)ur of
a journey of more than 200 miles, and the obligation

of buying at second hand what they thus obtain at
the first. The French likewise find it much more
to their advantage to buy their effects of the Eng-
lish at New York, than to bring them from tlieir
colonies, encountering the troublesome navigation
from the mouth of the river St. Lawrence to Mont-
real. The English, under the command of General
Wolfe, conquered this province at the expence of
much bloodshed, and with the loss of the general
himself. Tliey remained masters of it by the peace
of the year 1763, establishing (in order to avoid
occasions of dispute in future) its limits by a line
drawn through the middle of the river Mississippi
and the lakes Maurepas and Pontchartrain to the
sea ; but it was delivered over to the French in the
peace of 1783. Its capital is Quebec.

1. Situation and Division . — The British provinces
of Upper and Lower Canada, constituted by act of
parliament in 1791, comprehend the territory here-
tofore called Canada. They lie between 61° and
81“ w. long, from London, and between 42° 30'
and 52° n. lat. ; in length about 1400 miles, and
in breadth 500. Bounded n. by New Britain and
unknown countries ; e. by New Britain and the
gulf of St Lawrence ; 5. e. and s. by the province
of New Brunswick, the district of [[Maine]], New
Hampshire, Vermont, New York, and the lakes ;
the w. boundary is undefined. The province
of Upper Canada is the same as what has been com-
monly called the Upper Countrj^ It liesw. of the
great lakes, and is separated trom New York by
the river St. Lawrence, here called the Cataraqui,
and the lakes Ontario and Erie. Lower Canada
lies on both sides the river St. Lawrence between
61° and 71° w. long, from London, and 45° and
52° n. lat. and is bounded s. by New Brunswick,
Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York;
and zo. by Upper Canada. The line between Up-
per and liOwer Canada commences at a stone
boundary on the n. bank of lake St. Francis, in
St. Lawrence river, at the cove zo. of Point au
Boudet, thence n. to Oltawas river, and to its source
in lake Tomiscaning, thence due n. till it strikes
the boundary of Hudson bay, or New Britain.}
