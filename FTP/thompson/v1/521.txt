[bring in exchange dry goods, and this they do
either by avoiding the vigilance of the guards, or
by purchasing a connivance. The population of
Coi^ is composed of 10,000 people of all colours ;
few slaves are to be seen here, since the Indians,
although they everywhere else have a particular
partiality for the blacks, entertain a decided aver-
sion against them in this city. This antipathy
was very useful in 1797 to the public tranquillity,
for when the Negro slaves employed at w ork in
the fields, wished to follow the example of the
blacks of St. Domingo, and selected chiefs, under
whom they committed some robberies, the In-
dians of Corojoined the white people, and marched
against the rebels with most extraordinary cou-
rage ; the revolt was thus suppressed almost as
soon as it broke out ; the ring-leaders were hang-
ed, and every thing was restored to order ; the
rebel army never amounted to more than 400
blacks. All work at Coro is done by Indians,
notwithstanding the wages are very low ; indeed
they li ve here with so much parsimony that a per-
son cannot fetch fire from his neighbour’s without
carrying in exchange a piece of wood of the size
of the firing he takes away, and even this is not
always done without difficulty. The city has no
spring, and the water they drink is brought from
the distance of half a league by asses in barrels, of
which two compose a load. The houses, though
originally well built, bear evident marks of misery,
and of the ravages of time; those belongingto
the Indians are yet more pitiful. The streets run
in parallel lines, but are not paved ; the public
buildings consist of a parish church, formerly a
cathedral, which title is yet given to it by the in-
habitants, although for more than 160 years it
has been without a bishop or a chapter, the duty
being performed by two curates, belonging to a
convent containing about seven or eight Francis-
cans, and to a parish church in which are three
monks of the same order. The civil power is
exercised by a cahildo. Since 1799, a military
commandant has been established here, who shares
at the same time the judicatory authority, and that
of the police ; his revenue being 2000 dollars per
annum. Two miles to the n. of Coro is an isthmus
of about one league in breadth, which joins tlie pen-
insula of Paragona to the continent ; it stretches out
from the s. w. to n. w. about 20 leagues ; is inhabit-
ed by Indians and a few whites, whose only em-
ployment is the rearing of cattle, which they smug-
gle over in great numbers to Cura^oa ; the
butchers’ shops of that island being always better
supplied than those of the principal cities of Ticrra
Firme.
