continual invasions it has experienced from the
Pijaos and Pimaes Indians, who are a bold and
warlike people, determined its inhabitants to re-
move it at the end of the I7th century to the spot
where it now stands ; having bought for that pur-
pose some land of Tomasa Izquierdo, on the bank
of an arm of the river of La Vieja, which is a
large stream, and navigable for canoes and rafts,
and which is at the distance of rather better than
a quarter of a mile from the large river Cauca,
into which the above river enters, forming before
the city an island, which abounds in animals of the
chase, and in cattle, and having on its banks ex-
cellent fishing. This city is of a dry and healthy
climate ; and although hot, the atmosphere is al-
ways clear and serene. It is situate upon a level
and somewhat elevated plain , of beautiful appear-
ance ; the streets are spacious, wide and straight.
It has a very large grand square. Its buildings
are solid and of good structure, and universally
roofed over with straw, having, however, the walls
of solid stone from the top to the bottom ; others
are built of brick, and others with rafters of wood,
the walls being of clay, (which they call imbulidoSy
or inlaid), so solid as to resist the force of the most
violent earthquakes, as was experienced in one
that happened in 1785. At a small distance from
the city are various lakes or pools of water, which
they call denegas, formed by nature, assisted by
art. It is the residence of the lieutenant-gover-
nor of the government of [[Popayan]], of two ordi-
nary alcaldes, two of La Hermandad, two member*
of an inferior court, a recorder, a procurator-gene-
ral, a major domo de propiosy and six regidors^
the cabildo enjoying the privilege of electing and
confirming these officers yearly. It has also a bat-
talion of city militia, and two disciplined compa-
nies ; also some royal cofiers, which were brought
from the city of Anserma. Besides the church of
Matriz, in which is venerated, as the patroness, the
Holy Virgin, under the image of Nuestra Senora
de la Paz, (this being the pious gift of Philip
III.) it has five parishes, viz. Santa Ana, Santa
Barbara, Llano de Buga, Naranjo, Micos, and
Pueblo de los Cerritos. The territory is extremely
fertile and pleasant, abounding as well in fruits
and pulse as in birds of various sorts ; and in no
part whatever are plantains so various, or of so
fine a quality. Tlie coffee is good, and the cacao,
which is of two sorts, is excellent, and is called
yellow and purple hayna. Of no less estimation
is the tobacco, with which a great traffic was
formerly carried on at Choco. The district of this
city abounds in trees, medicinal herbs and fruits,
and in an exquisite variety of cacao plants; also
