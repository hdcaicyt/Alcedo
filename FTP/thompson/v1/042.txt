==[[America|AMERICA]]==, the Indies, or the New World,
one of the four parts of the Universe., and the
largest. It was riclier and better peopled in the
time of the Indians, and more fertile and abound-
ing in the necessaries and comforts of life. It is,
as it Avere, surrounded by the sea, and is indeed a
continent as far as the Arctic Pole, w here its boun-
daries have not been discovered. This immense
country, nearly 2000 leagues in length, was un-
knoAvn to the ancients, until it Avas discovered by
Christopher Columbus, a Genoese, in the service
of their Catholic Majesties, Don Fernando V.
and Doiia Isabel, in four folloAving voyages. In
tlie first voyage he departed from the port of Palos
de Moguer, Avith three small vessels and ninety
ii&gt;en, in the year 1491, and had to contend Avith

incredible difficulties, as Avell in combating the
prejudices of the Spaniards, who opposed his
ideas, holding his attempt as something chime-
rical, as in preserving the crews of the vessels that
accompanied the expedition ; many of whom,
depressed and tired with the labours and hard-
ships of so long a voyage, endeavoured to put an
end to their existence. It is improperly' called
America, from the celebrated pilot Horentin Ame-
rico Vespucio, who discovered the continent to the
s. of the equinoctial line : others will have that it
Avas before discovered by Sancho de Huelva, who
was driven there in a storm in the year 1484.
The English assert, that in 1170, or 1190, it was
discovered by a man of the name of Madoc, or
Madocro, son or brother of Ousen Quisneth,
prince of Wales, Avho, in two voyages to Virginia,
Florida, Canada and Mexico, founded English
colonies ; but this is a mere fable. This country
has produced, and yet produces gold, silver, and
other precious metals, in prodigious quantities, an
infinite variety of herbs, plants, fruits, roots, fish,
birds, and animals unknown, and such as had
never heretofore been seen ; an astonishing variety
of exquisite woods, some of the trees being of an
enormous size. Its natives, though, on account of
the innumerable nations and provinces of which it
is composed, differ entirely amongst each other,
were nevertheless all idolaters. The greater part
of this immense country, which is, from its size, as
it Avere unpeopled, is possessed by the Spaniards,
Avho were its discoA'erers and conquerors ; but after
this, the French, invited by its riches, established
themselves in different parts, as also did the En-
glish, the Portuguese, the Dutch, and the Danes.
America is divided into North and South by the
isthmus of Panama, or [[Tierra Firme]]. TheN. part,
known at the present day, extends from 11 to 70 de-
grees of latitude, and comprehends the kingdoms
of Nueva Espaila, California, Louisiana, Nuevo
Mexico, Virginia, Canada, NcAvfoundland , Florida,
and the islands of St. Domingo, Cuba, Jamaica,
Puerforico, and the other Antilles. The Meri-
dional or S. part extends itself from 12 degrees n.
lat. to 60 s. comprehending Tierra Firme, Darien,
the new kingdom of [[Granada]], Nueva Andalucia,
[[Peru]], Chile, Paraguay, Quilo, the country of the
Amazonas, [[Brasil|Brazil]], and the Tierras Magallanicas,
or of the Patagones. Its largest mountains are
those of the great chain, or cordillera of the Andes,
Avhich run from n. to s. from the isthmus of Pa-
nama to Cape Horn. The mountain Chimborazo
is the joftiest of any known in the Avorld at the pre-
sent day ; and others, especially those in Quito,
are of an e.xtraordinary height, and always covered
