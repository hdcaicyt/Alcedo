==[[Achagua|ACHAGUA]]==, a nation of Indians of the Nuevo
Reyno de Granada, who dwell among the plains
of Gazanare and Meta, and in the woods which
skirt the river Ele. They are bold in their en-
gagements with wild beasts, but with human be-
ings they have recourse rather to poison and
stratagem ; they are dexterous in the use of the
dart and spear, and never miss their aim ; are
particularly fond of horses, of which they take the
utmost care, anointing and rubbing them with oil ;
and it is a great thing among them to have one of
these animals of peculiar size ' and beauty. They
go naked, but, for the sake of decency, wear a
small apron made of the thread of aloes, the rest
of their bodies being painted of different colours.
They are accustomed, at the birth of their chil-
dren, to smear them with a bituminous ointment,
which hinders the hair from growing, even upon
the eye-brows. The women’s brows are also en-
tirely deprivecl of hair, and the juice of jagua
being immediately rubbed into the little holes
formed by the depilatory operation, they remain
bald for ever after. They are of a gentle disposi-
sition, but much given to intoxication. The
Jesuits reduced many to the catholic faith, forming
them into settlements, in 1661.
