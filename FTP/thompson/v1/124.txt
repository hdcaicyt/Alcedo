==[[Baguachica|BAGUACHICA]]==, a settlement of the province
and government of [[Jaen]] de Bracamoros in the
kingdom of [[Quito]].

==[[Bah Aire|BAH AIRE]]==, a settlement of the province and
government of [[Cartagena]] in the kingdom of
[[Tierra Firme]]. It was in the time of the Indians
a very populous city, containing upwards of
200,000 souls. It Was conquered with great diffi-
culty by Pedro de Heredia.

[==[[Bahama|BAHAMA]]==, Great Island of, one of the Ba-
hamas, of great extent, situate on the s. side of
the Little Bahama bank, and extending from the
Florida stream almost to the island of [[Abaco]]. It
contains a great quantity of fine timber, but which
is difficult of gccess. It is totally uninhabited.
See Bahamas.]

[==[[Bahama Channel|Bahama Channel]]==, or Gulph of Florida, is the
passage between the island of [[Bahama]] and the
continent. Its navigation is dangerous, and it has
been very erroneously set down in most of the best
maps. See the Bahamas.]

==[[Bahama]]==, New, a port of the island of [[Cuba]],
on the n. coast, between those of La Ciudad del
Principe and Manati.

==[[Bahamas|BAHAMAS]]==, Islands of the N. sea, situate to
the e. of, and opposite to Florida. They are of the
Lucayos, and were discovered by Columbus, in
his first voyage, in 1404. From them the fine
channel of Bahama takes its name, the same being
formed by the above coast, the principal of these
islands, and a long sand-bank of the same name,
to the n. of the island of [[Cuba]], and being 16 leagues
wide and 45 long. The currents in the gulph
are most violent, and in it numbers of ves-
sels have been wrecked. It is the direct pass into
the open sea, and for the route to Europe. It was
first attempted by the celebrated pilot Anton de
Alaminos, who risked its navigation with immi-
nent hazard, when he went to Spain with the
agents of Hernan Cortes, to give account to the
Emperor Charles V. of the progress of the con-
quest of Mexico. The principal island is 13
leagues long and eight wide ; is very fertile, of
an agreeable climate, and full of streams and
rivulets. It formerly produced much sassafras,
zarzaparrilla, and red wood ; but its present
productions are principally maize, birds, and a
kind of rabbit ; and it procures for itself other ne-
cessaries from Carolina. Its principal commerce
consists in supplying provisions to ships which
come here for convenience. Although these
islands are near 500, many of them are nothing
but cliffs or rocks.

[^General Description^ Climate^ Sfc . — The Baha-
ma islands, called Lucayos by the Spaniards, com-

prehend, under that denomination, all that chain
of West India islands lying to the n. of Cuba and
St. Domingo, and situate between the 21° and
28° of n. Ia;t. and the 71° and 81° of w. long.
These islands have never been regularly surveyed,
nor their numbers at all ascertained. Those most
worthy of attention are as follows ; and a more
particular description of each will be found under
its proper head.

set down or delineated in any of the maps or
charts of the West Indies. Many of them are
situated upon the Great Bahama bank, others
upon the Little Bahama bank, and others out of
soundings, in the Atlantic ocean. They stretch
from Turk’s islands (which are at no great dis-
tance from St. Domingo) in a n. w. direction to
the n. end of the Great Bahama bank, near the
coast of [[Florida]]. The climate is in general salu-
brious. The more n, of the islands during the
winter months are rendered cool and agreeable by
the n. w. breezes from the continent of America.
At New Providence the thermometer, (Farenheit),
in the shade, varies from about 85° or 90° in sum-
mer to 60° or 65° in winter. The more s. islands,
however, are hotter throughout the year; but
these enjoy the cooling sea breezes that blow in the
West Indies within the tropics, and which do not
extend to several of the most w. of the Bahamas.

==[[There is but little variety of soil throughout the
Bahama islands]]==. They are almost all l^ow, flat,
barren, and rocky. They are well provided with
natural woods, generally however of a small
growth. The soil is mostly either light and sandy,
or very rocky and broken, with partial spots of
good land. The rock is of a soft and porous na-
ture, but hard, and generally irregular on the sur-
face. The Bahamas are but ill supplied with]
