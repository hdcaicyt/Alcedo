’ CHETTMACHAS, a river of the province and
government of [[Louisiana]]. It is an arm of the
Mississippi, which runs s. e. and enters the sea on
the side of the bay of Asuncion or Ascension. [On
the Chetiraachas, six leagues from the Mississippi,
there is a settlement of Indians of the same name ;
and thus far it is uniformly 100 yards broad, and
from two to four fathoms cleep, vfhen the water is
lowest. Some drifted logs have formed a shoal at
its mouth on the Mississippi ; but as the water is
deep under them they could be easily removed;
and the Indians say there is nothing to impede na-
vigation from their village to the gulf. The banks
are more elevated than those of the Mississippi, and
in some places are so high as never to be over-
flowed. The natural productions are the same as
on the Mississippi, but the soil, from the extraordi-
nary size and compactness of the canes, is supe-
rior. If measures were adopted and pursued with
a view to improve this communication, there would
soon be on its banks the most prosperous and im-
portant settlements in that colony.]

a quarter of a mile wide. The country bor-
dering on these lakes is low and flat, timbered with
cypress, live and other kinds of oak ; and on the
€. side, the land between it and the Chafalaya river
is divided by innumerable streams, which occa-
sion as many islands. Some of these streams are*
navigable. A little distance from the s. e. short?
of the lake Chetimachas, is an island where per-
sons passing that way generally halt as a resting
place. Nearly opposite this island there is an
opening which leads to the sea. It is about 150
yards wide, and has 16 or 17 fathoms water.]
