fortress, which bears the name of St. Anne, was
an expence of 180,000 dollars; this has on the e.
side a small fort, mounted with eight pieces of can-
non, where arc preserved, under the care of a
good guard, tlie magazines of the ammunition and
provision. The citj is garrisoned bj 1200 men,
who are called the royal regiment of tlie infantry
guards : it is the seat of the governor, the conn”
cil, assembly, and court of chancery. At the dis-
tance of a mile to the n, e. of it the governor has
a beautiful house, which was built by the assem-
bly, called Pilgrims, althoui’h his ordinary resi-
dence is in Fontable : the other forts are to the w.
namely St. James’s, close to the inlet of Steward,
with 18 cannon ; Willoughby, with 20; and three
batteries, lying between the latter and fort Need-
ham, with 20 cannon. The Church ^ as large as
a good-sized cathedral, having a fine organ, a set of
bells, and a clock. This city has some good inns
and houses of refreshment ; also a post-office, at
which monthly foreign mails have been lately
established. Its shops and magazines are filled
with all kinds of European productions, and it is
filled with Englishmen and other foreigners, who
come here to merchandize. The air is somewhat
damp and unsalutary, owing to the neighbouring
lakes-; but, nevertheless, the inhabitants, born here,
maintain-ft'vigorous and healthy appearance. [This
city was burnt down April 18. 1668. It sutiered
also greatly byffires on Feb. 8. 1756, May 14.
1766, and Dec. 27. 1767, at which times the
greatest part of the town was destroyed : before
these fires it had 1500 houses, mostly brick, very
elegant, and said to be the finest and largest in all
the Charibbee islands ; the town has since been re-
built. it has a college, founded and liberally en-
dowed by Col. Codrington, the only institution of
the kind in the West Indies ; but it does not ap-
pear that its success has answered the designs of
the founder. This was the state of the capital of
ilarbadoes in the summer of 1780. It had scarcely
risen from the aslres to which it had been reduced
by the dreadful fires already mentioned, when it
was torn from its foundations, and the whole coun-
try made a scene of desolation, by the storm of the
10th of October 1780, in which above 4000 of the
inhabitants miserably perished ; the force of the
wind was then so great, as not only to blow down
the strongest walls, but even lifted some pieces of
cannon off the ramparts, and carried them some
yards distance; and the damage to the country in
general was estimated at 1 ,320,5047. 15s. sterling,
and it is scarcely yet restored to its former splen-
dour. [See Baubadoes.]

[==[[Biunc E To Wn|BiuncE-ToWN]]==, in Cumberland county, district
of Maine, having Hebron on the «. w. and Bakers-
town (on the w. side of Androscoggin river) on the
s. e. which three settlements lie on the n. side of
Little Androscoggin river. It contains 329 inha-
bitants, and lies 34 miles n. by «. w. from Port-
land, and 156 n. e. from Boston. Bridge-town
consists of large hills and valleys ; the high land
aftbrds red oak, which are often three feet, and
sometimes four, in diameter, and 60 or 70 feet
without any branches. The valleys are covered
Avith rock-maple, bass, ash, birch, pine, and hem-
lock. There is a curiosity to be seen in Long
pond, which lies mostly in Bridge-town, Avhich
may afford matter of speculation to the natural
philosopher. On the e. side of the pond is a cove
which extends about 100 rods farther e. than the
general course of the shore ; the bottom is clay,
and so shoal that a man may Avade 50 rods into the
pond. On the bottom of this cove are stones of
various sizes, Avhich it is evident, from various
circumstances, have an annual motion toAvards the
shore : the proof of this is the mark or track left
behind them, and the bodies of clay driven up
before them. Some of these stones are two or
three tons Aveight, and have left a track of several
rods behind them ; having, at least, a common cart-
load of clay before them. The shore of the cove
is lined with these stones, Avhich, it would seem,
have craAvled out of the \Aater. See Sebago
