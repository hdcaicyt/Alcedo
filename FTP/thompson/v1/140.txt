==[[B Alt Budo|BAltBUDO]]==, a settlement of the Nuevo Reyno
de Granada, founded by Francisco Henriquez, on
the shore of the river of La Magdalena, in 154 1 , in
the province of the Malebueyes : it was a large
population, and rich in gold mines ; these are
close in its vicinity, but are not worked at the pre-
sent day, upon which account it has fallen into the
utmost state of misery and decay.

==[[Bahbudos|BAHBUDOS]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians,
who inhabit the woods to the s. of the river Mara-
non, and to the e. ofthe Guallaga. They are ene-

are at present for the most part united, and re-
duced to a settled population by the missionaries,
the Jesuits of Mainas.

==[[Barburfs|BARBURFS]]==, a barbarous nation of the Nuevo
Reyno de Granada, inhabiting the mountains close
to the city of Pamplona, They are descendants

number, and are but little known.

==[[Barcas|BARCAS]]==, the alcaldia mayor of the kingdom
of Nueva Galicia, but of the bishopric of Mecho-
acan. Its capital, which bears the same name, is a
large town, having a numerous population of
Spaniards, Mustees, and Mulattoes. Its vicinity
also is well stocked with inhabitants, and near it
are many country-houses, estates, farm-houses,
and grazing lands for cattle of the large and small
sort. It is very pleasant and fertile, and in its
confines runs the large river of Guadalaxara, from
whence it lies 25 leagues to the e. s. e.

==[[Barcellos|BARCELLOS]]==, or San Cayetano, a city of
the province and country of the Amazonas, in the
Portuguese possessions, is on the shore of the

abundant river Negro, opposite the second deep
chasm of Varaca, the same forming one of the
arms by which this river is entered by that of Pa-
ravinanas, or Parime.

==[[Barcelona|BARCELONA]]==, a province of the government
of Cumana, one of the three which compose that
government; bounded on the w. by Cumana, e. by
Caracas, and s. by the river Orinoco, which also
divides it from Guayana. All the front looking to
the n. is a part of the serrama, Avhich commences
at the Punta de Paria, and runs as far as Santa
Marta. At the distance of nine leagues to the
back of this province, begin the extensive llanos.,
which bear its name, and which, uniting with those
of Caracas, run s. as far as the Orinoco ; but these
llanos are nothing more than barren wastes, pro-
ducing no herbs, though they are nevertheless well
stocked with cattle, which breed here in great
abundance, and which derive their food from the
rank herbage which grows upon the banks of the
rivers; and when these suffer from drought, the fa-
tality amongst these poor creatures is, of course, ter-
rible. The temperature here is the same as that of
Cumana, though not so unhealthy. This province
produces nothing but maize, plantains, and

such other fruits as are found in the above-mention-
ed province, and even these in nogreat abundance.
It is however noted for its cattle ; and the inhabi-
tants have a method of salting down meats, which
they call iasajo, and which they export to the
islands of Margarita, Trinidad, and to other parts.
With regard to the skins, a third part of them are
sent to St. Domingo and Puertorico, and the rest
are exported by the Dutch ; and it is calculated
that not less than from 8 to 9000 head of cattle
are killed here annually. Its coast abounds in fish,
but they are neither so plentiful, nor of so fine a fla-
vour, as upon the coast of [[Cumana]]. It has four
small salt-pits, of which the natives make free use,
and this without any other trouble than that of
merely extracting the salt. Its principal rivers are
those of Barcelona and Unare, both of which run
n. A species of palm is very common throughout
the whole province ; it resembles the date-tree,
which is called here moriche, producing every
year a rivulet of water, and many of them toge-
ther a very tolerable stream, from a tendency
which has been discovered in this plant to ab-
sorb the moisture from the earth. Tliis province
contains 32 settlements, viz- three liead-towns, the
capital of its name, Aragua, and Concepcion de
Pao, 15 consecrated villages, and 17 of missions
or reducciones of Indians, which areas follows :
