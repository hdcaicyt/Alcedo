t])uuz, Santa, an island oftheN. sea,^one of the
Antilles, 22 leagues long and five wide. Its terri-
tory is fertile, but the air unhealthy at certain sea-
sons, from the low situation. It has many rivers,
streams, and fountains, with three very good and
convenient ports. It was for a long while desert,
until some English settled themselves in it, and
began to cultivate it; afterwards the French pos-
sessed themselves of it, in 1650, and sold it the
following year to the knights of Malta, from whom
it was bought, in 1664, by the West India com-
pany. In 1674, it was incorporated with the pos-
sessions of the crown by the king of France. Its
inhabitants afterwards removed to the island of [[St]].
Domingo, demolished the forts, and sold it to a
company of Danes, of Copenhagen, who now
possess it. It was the first of the Antilles which
was occupied by the Spaniards ; is SO leagues

from the island of [[St]]. Christopher’s, eight from
Puertorico, six from that of Boriquen, and five
from that of St. Thomas. It abounds in sugars
cane and tobacco, as also in fruits, which render
it very delightful. [It is said to produce SO, 000
or 40,000 hhds. of sugar annually, and other W.
India commodities, in tolerable plenty. It is in
a high state of cultivation, and has about 3000
white inhabitants and 30,000 slaves. A great
proportion of the Negroes of this island have em-
braced Christianity, under the Moravian mission-
aries, whose influence has been greatly promotive
of its prosperity.
