==[[The Capital Was Founded In 1634 By Don Juan
De Urpin|The capital was founded in 1634 by Don Juan
de Urpin]]==, on a level upon the shores of the river of
its name, at half a league’s distance from the sea.
Its soil is very uneven ; and as it is not paved, it
becomes in the winter extremely rugged and incon-
venient, through the rains, as also dusty and dis-
agreeable in the summer, on account of the dust,
which flies about in all directions, if the wind blow
ever so mildly. It is an open town, without any
fortification, small, and containing 500 house-
keepers, who are masters of 150 small estates, some
of which are of cacao, situate in the valley of
Cupira, in the province of [[Caracas]], and from
whence the productions are not allowed to be ex-
ported. The other estates are of the larger cattle,
in which arc counted upwards of 40,000 head,
which would be sufficient completely to enrich
any other country where they might not be rated
at so low a price ; for it is common for one head
to bring no more than two dollars and a half, if
paid in real money, and four if in effects ; and
this may be considered the cause why this place is
so poor, notwithstanding that its natives arc the
most industrious of any in the province. It con-
tains, besides the parish church, which is not yet
finished, another, with a hospital for the religious
Franciscans of the missions of Piritu. Twelve leagues
from the capital, Cumana ; but this distance, on ac-
count of the badness of the roads, and unevenness
of the country, should be estimated at no less than
^^0. [Its population, according to Depons, is
14,000 souls, and it has only one parish church,
and an hospital for the Franciscans, rvho bear the
expence of the missions to these parts. The great
number of hogs that are bred here cause in the city
infectious sewers, which corrupt the air and en-
gender diseases. The cabildo, whose principal
office is to watch over tlie salubrity of the inhabi-

tants, leave them indifferently exposed to all the
malignity of the infectious effluvia, the danger of
which they themselves partake. However, towards
the end of 1803, M. Cagigal, the commander of
the place, took some wise measures to rid the city
of an infection which could not but be fatal to per-
sons staying there. This city was originally
peopled by inhabitants from St. Christophe de Cu-
inanagoto, for which it has been in some manner
substituted. Agriculture is much neglected in
Barcelona and the environs. The most cultivated
valleys are those of Capirimal and Brigantin.
There are others as fertile,which have never receiv-
ed the plough-share. Depons asserts, that they
do not yield above 3000 quintals of cacao, with
some little cotton ; and Humboldt admits, at an
average of four years, from 1799 to 1803, the
quantity of cacao exported from hence to have
amounted to 5000 fanegas. This part of the
country is almost without slaves ; they compute
but 2000 on a surface which would employ 600,000,
and one half of the 2000 are occupied in domestic
services. Besides the horned cattle that they sold
for the use of the country, or for exportation, the
inhabitants killed a prodigious quantity, which,
they salted and sold in the neighbouring islands,
and at the Havannah, at a profit of cent, per cent.
The tallow and hides were also a considerable
article of traffic. At present this resource is great-
ly diminished, without being destroyed. The
robbers, who, since 1807, commit with impunity
their devastations on the herds, have reduced this
province to such a scarcity in animals, that they
have hardly enough for their butchers’ shops.

==[[The Population Of Barcelona Is Composed Of
One Half Whites And The Other People Of Colour|The population of Barcelona is composed of
one half whites and the other people of colour]]==.
The latter are as useless in agriculture here as every
where else. Among the whites there are some Cata-
lonians, who are entirely merchants, whose specu-
lations are in prohibited as well as in lawful goods.
By their frequent voyages to the ports of Trinidad,
they bring in return only contraband goods, for
Avhich Barcelona is the emporium, and which af-
terwards are diffused throughout the provinces,
as well by sea as by land. It is computed that
400,000 piastres fortes are annually exported from
Barcelona for this clandestine trade. The city
