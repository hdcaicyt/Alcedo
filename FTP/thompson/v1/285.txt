[==[[Cances Are A Very Numerous Indian Nation Of
N|CANCES are a very numerous Indian nation of
N]]==. America, consisting of a great many different
tribes, occupying different parts of the country
from the bay of St. Bernard, in the gulf of Mexico,
across the Rio Grande del Norte, and towards La
Vera Cruz. They are not friendly to the Spa-
niards, and generally kill them when they have an
opportunity. They are attached to the French,
are good hunters, principally using the bow.
They are very particular in their dress, which is
made of neatly dressed leather ; the women wear a

long loose robe, resembling that of a Franciscan
friar ; nothing but their heads and feet are to be seen.
The dress of the men consists of straight leather leg-
gings resembling pantaloons, and a leather hunting
shirt or frock. No estimate can be made of their
number. Thirty or forty years ago, the Spaniards
used to make slaves of them when they could take
them ; a considerable number of the n were brought
to Nachitoches, and sold to the French inhabitants
at 40 or 50 dollars a head, and a number of them
are still living here, but are now free. About 20
years ago, an order came from the king of Spain
that no more Indians should be made slaves, and
those that were enslaved should be emancipated ;
after rvhich, some of the women who had been ser-
vants in good families, and taught spinning, sew-
ing, &c. as well as managing Jiousehold affairs,
married natives of the country, and became re-
spectable, Avell-behaved women, and have now
growing up, decent families of children ; have a
language peculiar to themselves, and are under-
stood, by signs, by all others. They are in amity
with all other Indians except the Ilietans.]
