[the claimants. The loss of a good business, or an
estate, has sometimes been the consequence of this
law. The parents now get wiser, and make wills
which regulate the disposal of their property agree-
able to the wishes of the survivor. The law of
dowers has also given rise frequently to fraud.
Some of the Canadians have opened a store with
goods purchased on credit, and made over, per-
haps, one-half to the wife as her dower ; they have
then failed, and their creditors have lost their
money. Some alterations and improvements have,
however, been introduced of late, which render
collusion, in such cases, less practicable. No pro-
perty in Lower Canada is secure to the purchaser,
unless advertised and sold by the sheriff*, which
clears it from all incumbrances and after-claims.
Sometimes a written agreement is entered into be-
tween the buyer and seller, in which the latter ex-
onerates the former from all claims upon the pro-
perty ; but this is far from being safe, and is rely-
ing wholly upon the honour of anotlxer ; for the
buildings, lands, &c. may be seized by the credi-
tors of the estate, even though it might have passed
through 20 private sales since the debts were con-
tracted. The sale of property advertised by the
sheriff, may be delayed by an opposition put in
for the wifeâ€™s dower, or on account of an illegal
seizure. The power of arrests in Canada is limited.
If an aflSdavit is made, that a man is about to leave
the province in debt, for a sum exceeding 10/.
sterling, the debtor may be arrested, and detained
in prison until the debt is paid. But if he will
swear that he is not worth 10/. sterling, the court
will order the creditor to pay him five shillings
currency per week.

==[[From The Foregoing Sketch Of Canadian Juris 
Prudence|From the foregoing sketch of Canadian juris-
prudence]]==, it may be easily conceived how puz-
zling and intricate some parts of the civil law
must prove, and how much the Habitans are ex-
posed and laid open to oppression from their
seigniors, under the feudal tenures. This sub-
ject was formerly canvassed in the provincial as-
sembly by some of the English members, who
were for having proper bounds fixed to the power
of the seigniors, and having all the fines and ser-
vices due from their vassals accurately ascertained,
and made generally known. But the French
members, who had a great majority in the house,
strongly opposed it, and the subject was dropped.
Instances of oppression on the part of the seigniors
are, however, fortunately very rare, and the Ha-
bitans enjoy their property quiet and unmolested ;
yet, in case of violent outrage, they can always
come under the protecting power of the British
laws, which will afford them that security of which

their own are destitute. The Canadians have no
reason to complain of the change of government.
Before the conquest, they were often unacquainted
with that protection which the laws now afford
them.

==[[The Lawyers Who Practise In Lower Canada

Most Are English|The lawyers who practise in Lower Canada

and in the double capacity of counsellor and at-
torney : formerly they included the profession of
notary public ; but that is now separated from the
rest, and forms a distinct profession. Law-suits
are numerous, and are daily increasing, as may be
ascertained by the duties upon them, for the pur-
pose of erecting the new court-house at Quebec.
In 1800 this tax produced 500/. per annum; and
in 1807 it had increased nearly to 1000/. per
annum. The duty is now discontinued, as the
object for which it was levied is accomplished.
The building cost about 5000/. currency.
