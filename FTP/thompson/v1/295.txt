in America, and they reckon the gold it has pro-
duced at 33 millions of dollars, without counting
that which has been concealed ; but at present they
scarce procure from it 200 pound weight a year,
on account of the increased charges of labour, and
the want of energy in the inhabitants. Many lumps
of gold have been found Iiere, among which there
is still remembered to have been one of the figure of
a horse, which weighed 100 weight and some odd
pounds, and which was carried to the Emperor
Charles V. ; and likewise another lump which was
sent to Philip II. bearing a resemblance to the
head of a man, which, however, was lost together
with much other riches in the channel of Bahama.
This latter lump was found in the washing place of
y nahuaya. Nearly the whole of the territory of this
province is interspered with gold. The most cele-
brated washing places that it had were called San
J uan del Oro, Paulo Coya, Ananea, and that which
was superior to all, Aporoma. In the year 1713, a
lump of silver also was discovered in the mountain
of Ucuntaya, being of a very solid piece of metal,
and of prodigious value ; in its rivers are found
sands of gold, to which at certain times of the year,
the Indians have recourse, in order to pay their tri-
butes. There are also other mines of silver and
copper in various parts, and springs of hot water.
It is very liable to earthquakes, and according to
the tradition of the Indians, there was one which
took place before the conquest, so large as to over-
turn mountains, and that, opening the earth, it
swallowed up in an abyss many towns with their
inhabitants. They likewise assert, that in the year
1747, another earthquake, throwing out of the
ground a dirty and muddy water, thereby infected
the rivers to such a degree as to cause a dreadful
and general mortality. It has some large rivers
as well as small ; all of which empty themselves
into the Ynarabari, thus rendering this river ex-
tremely abundant : towards the n. and n. e. which,
as we have observed, is bounded by the infidel In-
dians, there are large tracts of ground covered with
coca and rice, Avith an abundance of mountain
fruits. In the aforesaid river they are accustomed
to take shad and large dories by shooting them
Avith muskets, or by piercing them with arroAvs or
darts. There are also some lakes, which, although
without fish, abound in ducks, snipes, and other
aquatic fowl. The infidel Indians have made va-
rious irruptions into this province: its capital is
Sandia, and its natives, who amount to 28,000, are
divided into 26 settlements, as follows : The repar-
timiento received by the corregidor used to amount
to 82,800 dollars, and it paid 662 yearly for ulcaxala.
