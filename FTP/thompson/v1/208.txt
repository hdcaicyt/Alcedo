[sessions, endeavoured as far as possible to limit
these unauthorised connections. Asserting that
the Portuguese had no right to advance beyond
cannon-shot from their own walls, orders were
given to occupy the n. banks of the Plata,
from its month to St. Sacrament, with flocks and
herds of cattle. The villages of Maldonado and
Montevideo were built, and every other measure
adopted to secure the possession of this interme-
diate domain.

The Part Of Spain Quickly Revived Those Feuds And
Animosities Which Had Been Suspended By Their
Commercial Intercourse With The Portuguese|These unexpected and offensive proceedings on
the part of Spain quickly revived those feuds and
animosities which had been suspended by their
commercial intercourse with the Portuguese]]==, and
which in a little time would have been wholly
forgotten. A clandestine war, to which the peo-
ple were stimulated by the agents of their resptec-
tive governments, was carried on for some time,
and the two nations were on the brink of an open
rupture, when a treaty was proposed, in 1750,
that appeared well calculated to terminate the
diflerences between these monarchies. By this
treaty the Portuguese agreed to exchange the
colony of [[St]]. Sacrament, and the territory annex-
ed to it, for the seven missions established by
Spain on the c. coast of the Uruguay. Consi-
siderable opposition was, however, expected to
the execution of this treaty in America. “ The
Jesuits,” says the Abbe liaynal, “ who from their
earliest origin had opened to themselves a secret
road to dominion, might have objected to the
dismembering of an empire which owed its ex-
istence to their labours. Independent of this great
interest, they might have thought themselves
responsible for the prosperity of a docile set of
people, who, by throwing themselves into their
arms, had entrusted them with the care of their
future welfare. These tribes had not, besides,
been conquered, and therefore when they sub-
mitted to Spain, they did not give to that crown
the right of alienating them from its dominion.
Without having reflected on the incontestible
rights of nations, they might imagine that it be-
longed to them alone to determine what was con-
ducive to their happiness. The horror they were
well known to entertain for the Portuguese yoke,
was equally capable of leading them astray, or
of enlightening them.” Whatever may be thought
of these speculations, whether the above, or what-
ever other motives operated on the seven ceded
provinces, it is certain that they prepared to repel
by force the united armies of Spain and Portugal,
which had been sent from Europe to enforce the
execution of the treaty. Unfortunately, how-
ever, their military skill and conduct did not

equal their love of independence ; for instead of
harassing the enemy, and cutting off their sup-
plies, which they were obliged to procure from a
great distance, they imprudently waited for them
in the open field. Being defeated in a pitched
battle with considerable slaughter, which discon-
certed their measures, they abandoned their ter-
ritory without another effort.

==[[In consequence of this event]]==, the Spaniards
conceived themselves warranted to take posses-^
sion of the colony of [[St]]. Sacrament, which was,
however, resisted by the Portuguese, on the pre-
tence that the inhabitants of the Uruguay were
only dispersed, and would, in all probability,
endeavour to regain a territory from which thejr
had been forcibly expelled. These difficulties re-
tarded the conclusion of the treaty, which was at
length finally broken off in 1761.

12, Treaties of 1777 and 1778.— From that period
these deserts once more became the theatre of war
and bloodshed, till Portugal, deprived of the
assistance of her most powerful allies, was at length
forced to submit. By the treaties of 1777 and
1778, she relinquished for ever the colony of [[St]]»
Sacrament, but received in exchange the terri-
tory of the river St. Peter, of which she had been
formerly deprived.

==[[While These Enterprises Were Going Forward
On The Amazon And The Plata|While these enterprises were going forward
on the Amazon and the Plata]]==, the more peaceful
and industrious citizens on the coast of [[[[Brasil|Brazil]]]]
were endeavouring to increase the useful produc-
tions of the colony, and to give respectability
and permanency to her commercial undertak-
ings.

13. State of commerce, mines, 8fc. — — Since
the prince regent came to the [[Brasil|Brazil]]s, the trade
has increased greatly. Before this period it was
carried on with Europe in large ships, similar to-
our East Indiamen ; but it is of course now thrown
open to all nations.

==[[Mr]]==. Humboldt, who takes fiw his authority
the work of Correa de Serra, makes the annual
produce of the mines of this kingdom amount to
29,900 Spanish marks of pure gold, the value of
which, in dollars, is 4,360,000, at 145/o\^ dollars
to the Spanish mark. This estimate we strongly
suspect to be exaggerated, as 16 years ago Bra-
zil did not furnish 20,000&gt; marks annually, and
as many years preceding, the supply from it
had been diminishing every year.
