of the province and kingdom of [[Tierra Firme]], and
government of [[Panama]] ; situate on the shore of
the river Mamoni ; is of a kind temperature, fer-
tile and agreeable, though little cultivated. The
air is however so pure that it is resorted to by
invalids, and seldom fails of affording a speedy
relief. It has a fort, which is an esfacada, or sur-
rounded with palisades, having a ditch furnished
with six small cannon, and being manned by a
detachment from the garrison of Panama, for the
purpose of suppressing the encroachments of the
infidel Indians of Darien. This territory was dis-
covered by Tello Guzman in 1515, who gave it
the name of Chepo, through its Cazique Chepauri,
in 1679. It was invaded by the pirates Bartholo-
mew Charps, John Guarlem, and Edward Bol-

such vessels as cruise in these seas, being the most
