[==[[Campbell’s Salines|Campbell’s Salines]]==, in North Holston, in the
state of [[Tennessee]], are the only ones that have yet
been discovered on the upper branches of the Ten-
nessee, though great search has been made for them.
Large bones, like those found at Big Bone lick,
have been dug up here ; and oJier circumstances
render the tract wliich contains the salines a great
natural curiosity. Captain Charles Campbell, one
of the first explorers of the w. country, made
the discovery of this tract in 1745. In 1753 he
obtained a patent for it from the governor of Vir-
ginia. His .son, the late General William Camp-
bell, the same who behaved so gallantly in the years
1780 and 1781, became owner of it on his death.
But it was not till the time of his death, when salt
was very scarce and dear, that salt water was dis-
covered, and salt made by a poor man. Since
that time it has been improved to a considerable ex-
tent, and many thousands of people are now sup-
plied from it with salt of a superior quality, and
at a low price. The tract consists of about 300
acres of salt marsh land, of as rich a soil as can
be imagined. In this flat, pits ai'e sunk, in order
to obtain the salt water. The best is found from
30 to 40 feet deep; after passing through the rich
soil or mud, from six to 10 feet, you come to a
very brittle lime-stone rock, with cracks or chasms,
through which the salt-water issues into the pits,
whence it is drawn by buckets and put into the
boilers, which are placed in furnaces adjoining the
pits. The hills that surround this flat are covered
