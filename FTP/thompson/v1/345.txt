is the celebrated mountain and mine of Lauri-
cocha.

==[[Caxamau Quiii La Y Co Ll Aos|CAXAMAUQuiiiLA Y CoLLAos]]==, til c territory of
the missions which forms part of the former pro-
vince, and which is a reduccion of the infidel moun-
tain Indians, who have been converted by the
monks of St. Francis: these Indians are main-
tained by a portion paid by the kin«?’s procurator
out of the royal coffers at Lima. They dwell to
the e. of the province, and are reduced to four
settlements ; two of the Ibita, and two of the Cho-
lona nation. It is now 90 years since their foun-
dation, and the number of Indians may at present
amount to 2000. Those settlements are situate
upon mountains covered with trees and thick
woods ; from whence the natives procure incense,
cffCflo, resinous gums, oil of Maria, dragon’s blood,
the reed called bejuco^ dried fish, honey, wax,
monkeys, parrots, and macaws, whicli^ are the
branches of its commerce ; tliough not less so is
the coca plant, which they pack up in measures of
four bushels each , and carry in abundance to different
parts, for the consumption of the whole province.
The missionaries of the above order have made
various attempts, and have spared neither pains
nor labour in penetrating into the interior parts of
the mountains ; having repeatedly discovered other
barbarous nations, whom they would fain have re-
duced to the divine knowledge of the gospel.

==[[Caxatambo|CAXATAMBO]]==, a province and. corregimiento
of [[Peru]], bounded n. by that of lluailas, n. e. by
that of Conchuios, e. by that of Huamalies, s. e.
by that of Tarma, s. by the part of Chancay called
Checras, s. e. by the low part of Chancay, and n.
w. by that of Santa. It is in length 34 leagues n. e.
s. w. and 32 in width n. w. s. e. ; the greater
part of it is situate in a serrama. Its temperature
is consequently cold, except in the broken and un-
even spots and in the low lands. Besides the pro-
ductions peculiar to the serrama., this province
abounds in all sorts of seeds and fruits; in all
species of cattle, especially of the sheep kind, from
the fleece of whicli its inhabitants manufacture
much cloth peculiar to the country ; this being
the principal source of its commerce. It produces
some grain and cochineal, used for dyes ; and if this
latter article were cultivated, it would bring great
profit. Amongst tlie mountains of this province
there is one called Huilagirca of fine flint, and two
mines of sulphur and alcaparrosa, articles employed
in the colouring of wools, not only in this province,

but in those of Huanuco, Huamalies, and Jauja:
It has also mines of good yeso or gypsum. The
principal rivers by which it is irrigated, are two
which rise in the same soil, and both of which enter
the S. sea, after having laved the contiguous pro-
vinces ^ in former times there were fine silver mines,
which are still worked, but for some reason or other,
to very little profit. On the n. c. part, on some emi-
nences, is a spot called Las Tres Cruces, (The Three
Crosses), there being as many of these fixed up here
to determine its boundaries, and that of the pro-
vince of Santa Huailas. Its population consists of
the 69 following settlements : its repartimiento used
to amount to 1^0, (XX) dollars, and the akavala to
1046 dollars per annum.
