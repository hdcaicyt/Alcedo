called Colan, as well as the settlement ; and though
distinct from Cachimayu, it is not so from Cata-
mayu, as is erroneously stated by Mr. La Marti-
niere. [Here they make large rafts of logs, which
will carry 60 or 70 tons of goods ; with these they
make long voyages, even to Panama, 5 or 600
leagues distant, 'fhey have a mast with a sail
fastened to it. They always go before the wind,
being unable to ply against it ; and therefore only
fit for these seas, where the wind is always in a
manner the same, not varying above a point or two
all the way from Lima, till they come into the bay
of Panama ; and there they must sometimes w'ait
for a change. Their cargo is usually wine, oil,
sugar, Quito cloth, soap, and dressed goat-skins.
The float is usually navigated by three or four men,
who sell their float where they dispose of their
cargo ; and return as passengers to the port they
came from. The Indians go out at night by the
help of the land-wind with fishing floats, more
manageable than the others, though these have
masts and sails too, and return again in the dav
time with the sea-wind.] Lat. 4° 56' s.
