==[[Acayuca|ACAYUCA]]==, the alculdia mayor of [[Nueva]] Es-
pana, and of the province of [[Goazacoalco]]. Its
jurisdiction is very extended, and consists, for the
most part, of places of a hot and moist temperature,
but so fertile is it that it gives annually lour crops
of maize; and as there is no demand tor this pro-
duction in the other provinces, it follows, of course,
that the Indians here are little given to industry.
Indeed the ground never requires the plough, and
the whole of their labours during the seed-time
consist merely in smoothing tlie surface of the
mountains, and in scratching up the ground with
a pointed stick. It is at times infested by locusts,
which destroy the plants and crops ; and having
never been able to find a remedy against this evil,
the inhabitants had recourse to the protection of
the virgin of La Conception, Avhich is revered in
the head settlement of the district of the Chichi-
mecas ; and it is said that, owing to her mediatory
influence, the plague has been thought to diminish.
This province is watered by the abundant river of
the Goazacoalco. The settlements of this alcaldia
are,

[==[[Accocesaws|ACCOCESAWS]]==. The ancient town and prin-
cipal place of residence of these Indians is on the
w. side of Colorado of Rio Rouge, about 200 mites
s. w. of Nacogdoches, but they often change their
place of residence for a season : being near the
bay, they make great use of fish, oysters &c. ;
kill a great many deer, which are the largest and
fattest in the province ; and their country is uni-
versally said to be inferior to no part of the pro-
vince in soil, growth of timber, goodnessof water,
and beauty of surface ; they have a language pe-
culiar to themselves, but have a mode of commu-
nication by dumb signs, which they all understand ;
number about 80 men. Thirty or forty years
ago, the Spaniards had a mission here, but broke
it up, or moved it to Nacogdoches. They talk
of resettling it, and speak in the highest terms of
the country.]
