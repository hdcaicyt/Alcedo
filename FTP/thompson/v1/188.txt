ness of disposition in some private dissensions, and
a successor was nominated in,

26. Don Vasco Mascarenas, Count of Ovidos,
governor of the armies and province of [[Alentejo]],
who had been viceroy of India, of the council of
Â«tate, and second viceroy of the kingdom of [[Bra]]-
zil: he entered in the year 1664, and owing to
the skill he had obtained from having been briga-
dier and general of the artillery, he governed with
great address five years, until 1668.

27. Alexandro de Sousa Freyre, who, after a
very meritorious career, was governor of the fort of
Mazagan in Africa : he was removed to this go-
vernment, where he remained until 1671.

28. Alonso Thurtado de Mendoza, esteemed
equally for his noble birth as for his heroic valour ;
he being renowned amongst the greatest warriors
of his age. Disappointment in his attempts to
discover some mines caused his death in 1675 ; but
he had nominated, as governor for the interim,
the chancellor, Augustin Acevedo Montero, the
eldest brigadier, Alvaro de Acevedo, and the eldest
judge, Antonio Guedes de Brito ; these governed
for upwards of two years, until 1678, when the
right successor arrived, viz.

29. Roque de Acosta Barreto, a person whose
good qualities had secured the favour of the court,
and had obtained for him employments equal to
his pretensions : lie was major-general in the pro-
vince of [[Brasil|Brazil]] at the timethat he was nominated go-
vernor and captain-general of Brazil ; and the ap-
plause whicli he deserved by his virtues warranted
his election ; for the kiiigdom had to reckon him
amongst the best of its governors ; here he conti-
nued until the year 1682.

50. Antonio de Sousa Menescs, a man of great
merits : he had lost an arm, which was replaced
by one of silver ; he had grown old in government
and in various employs, and indeed he was at this
time rather superannuated ; the consequence was,
that great dissensions and commotions marked the
period of his government, which lasted until 1682,
when arrived,

51. Don Antonio Luis de Sousa, Tello de Me-
nescs, Marquis of Las Minas : he was found exer-
cising the government of [[Las]] Armas, and province of
Entre Douro and Miilo, from whence he was witii-
drawn, on account of his well-established fame, to
settle tlie disturbances prevailing in [[Brasil|Brazil]]; tothese
lie lent his most serious attention : he was also ser-
viceable in rendering succour and a?sis(a tce to
the natives during the terrible contagion which they
suffered during Ids gove-mment ; tids lasted until
1687, when soliciting his return to Lisbon, a sue-
successor was appointed in the person of,

32. Matias de Acuna, commissary-general of tire
cavalry of Montejo, brigadier of the 3d regiment of
the Armada, and governor of the Rio Janeiro, and
afterwards of the province of [[Entre]] Douro y Minoi:
here he displayed much talent and justice ; but died
in a short time, in 1688, nominating, in the interim,
witli the approbation of all, a successor in the
archbishop, Don Fr. Manuel de la Resurreccion,
who kept the reins of government until the
year 1690.

==[[S3]]==. Antonio Luis Gonzalez de Camara Cou-
tinho, who was at that time governor of the pro-
vince of Pernambuco, and was elected to the cap-
ta/ws/np-general of [[Brasil|Brazil]], of which he took posses-
sion in 1690, and which he exercised until 1694.

34. John of Lancaster, of the royal family of
England, who began his military career at a very
early age, and being captain of horse, distinguished
himself in the battle of the Canal : he was after-
wards brigadier-general of the 3d regiment of the
Armada, governor and captain -general of Angola^
general of the horse of Alentejo, and, lastly, cap-
tain-general of [[Brasil|Brazil]], of which dignity he took
possession in 1694 ; and during a much longer
government tlian was usually enjoyed, he gave
evident proofs of the extent of his abilities, by the
excellence of his plans for the public emolument,
and for the beneficence he shewed to those around
him ; he was succeeded in 1732 by,

35. Don Rodrigo de Costa, who, by his birth
and merits, had been the favourite of the monarch*
and governors of the island of [[Madeira]]: he was
made captain-general of [[Brasil|Brazil]], and from thence
promoted to the viceroyalty of India in 1705 ; he
was succeeded by,

36. Luis Cesar de Menescs, chief ensign of the
kingdom of [[Portugal]], a descendant of the renowned
Vasco Fernandez, and known alike for his happy
government in the Rio Janeiro, and in the king-
dom of Angola, as for that of the city of Ebora,
in the war of the succession of Philip V. king of
Spain : he came over to [[Brasil|Brazil]] in 1705, and re-
mained with singular credit until 1710, when ar-
rived liis successor,

37. Don Lorenzo de Almada, who was received
with some degree of discontent ; a true presage of
the ills and disturbances which marked his go-
vernment, and of the disputes which arose Avith
the government of [[Pernambuco]]; all these made
him very willing to resign his post, which he did
ki the folloAVing }mar, 1711, in favour of his
st-ccessor,

38. Don Pedro de Vasconcelos y Sousa, es-
teemed for his valour and conduct during the Avar:
