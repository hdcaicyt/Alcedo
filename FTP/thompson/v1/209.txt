[mamder ; buUhougli these governors are expected
to conform to tlie general regulations enacted by
the viceroy, they are wholly independent of his
authority, since they receive their i.istructions di-
rectly from the Portuguese government, and are
bound to transmit to Lisbon an account of the busi-
ness transacted in their several departments. They
are only appointed for three years, but their com-
mission is usually extended beyond that period.
They are prohibited by law from marrying in the
country under their jurisdiction, from being con-
cerned in any branch of trade, from accepting
any present whatsoever, from receiving any
emoluments for the functions of their office; and
these regulations have been very rigorously ad-
hered to for several years past. Individuals who
voluntarily resign their office, or who arc recalled
by the government, are obliged to give an account
of their conduct to commissioners appointed by the
mother country; and the citizens, whatever may
be their rank, are competent to impeach them. If
they happen to die while in office, the bishop, in
conjunction with the commanding officer and the
chief magistrate, immediately assume the reins of
government till the arrival of a successor.

==[[The Jurisprudence In [[Brasil|Brazil]] Is The Same As That
Of The Mother Country|The jurisprudence in Brazil is the same as that
of the mother country]]==. A judge resides in each
district, from whose decision an appeal lies to the
superior tribunals of Bahia, Rio dc Janeiro, and
even to those of Lisbon, if it be a question of great
importance. In the districts of Para and Mar inan,
they arc allowed, however, to appeal directly to
the mother country, without being obliged to ap-
j)car before the two intermediate tribunals already
mentioned. In criminal cases a different practice
is followed. The judge belonging to each parti-
cular district is empowered to punish petty misde-
meanours j while more enormous offences are
judged by the governor, assisted by a certain num-
ber of assessors appointed for this purpose. In
every province there is also established an especial
tribunal, in order to take cognizance of tliose lega-
cies bequeathed to persons residing beyond the
seas. They have no fixed salary, but are allowed
to deduct five per cent, from such capitals, the
remainder being transmitted to Portugal, and de-
posited in an office appropriated to the purpose.

==[[The Finances Of Each Province Are Administered
By The Commandant And Four Magistrates ; And
Their Accounts Are Annually Forwarded To The Royal
Treasury At Lisbon|The finances of each province are administered
by the commandant and four magistrates ; and
their accounts are annually forwarded to the royal

minute inspection. The military establishment is
here on the same footing as in Portugal and other
European countries. The troops are at the clis-

posal of the governor for the time being, Avho is
entrusted with the nomination of all the officers
under the rank of captain. The militia is in like
manner phtced under his controul. It is com-
posed of all the citizens indiscriminately, except
the hidulgoa, or highest order of nobility, who are
exempted from every kind of personal service.
This body of men furnish their own uniforms ; in
the interior parts of the country they are only as-
sembled in cases of absolute necessity ; but at
Pernambuco, Bahia, and other parts on the coast,
they are exercised one month every year, during
which tiiey receive pay from the government.
The Negroes and Mulattoes are embodied by them-
selves, but the Indians are incorporated along with
the colonists. The regular troops generally
amount to about 8000 men, and the militia to
upwards of 30,000.

==[[The king]]==, as grand-master of the order of
Christ, has the sole right to the tithes, as well
as to the produce of the crusade ; nevertheless,
six bishoprics have been established at different
times, which are all subordinate to the arch-
bishopric of Bahia, or Todos Santos, founded in
1352. The prelates, who fill those sees, are all of
them Europeans, and their salaries, which are
paid by the government, vary from 1200 to
30,000 livres (from 50/. to 1250/.)

==[[None of the inferior clergy are paid by the go-
vernment]]==, except the missionaries ; but, exclusive
of an annual tribute which they receive from every
family, they are paid 40 sols (is. Sd.) for every
birth, marriage, and burial ; and in the distriets
of the mines diis emolument is more than doubled.
No regular convents are established by law in
[[Brasil|Brazil]] ; but in a few of the districts, such as
Bahia, and at Rio de Janeiro, some e.stablish-
ments have been endowed for female devotees.
There are, however, more than 20 monasteries
belonging to different religious orders, the two
richest of which are occupied by Benedictine
monks. In the gold provinces these institutions
are prohibited bylaw ; tliough, while in the pleni-
tude of their power, the Jesuits had suificient in-
fluence to evade this salutary regulation ; but
since the period of their expulsion, no other re-
gular orders have been permitted to settle in those
regions.
