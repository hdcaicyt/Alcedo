panics of infantry, of 77 men each. The streets
are drawn in a straight line, hut are impassable for
carts in the wet season ; there are battlements or
projections on either side of them for the conve-
nience of foot-passengers. It may at the present
day be looked upon as the first commercial city in
^11 Spanish America. Its inhabitants amount to
3000 housekeepers. It is 70 leagues from the
moutii of the river La Plata.

1. General description. — [Buenos Ayres is
one of the most considerable towns in South Ame-
rica, and the only place of traffic to the s. of
[[Brasil|Brazil]]. It is in the s. division and province of
La Plata, is well fortified, and defended by a
numerous artillery. It has an elegant cathedral, a
small Indian church, and about 4000 houses. The
houses are generally two stories high, some built
of chalk, and others of brick ; most of these are
tiled. Buenos Ayres has its name on account of
the excellence of the air, and is situated on the s.
side of the river La Plata, where it is seven leagues
broad, 50 leagues from the sea. The ships get to
it by sailing up a river that wants depth, is full of
islands, shoals, and rocks ; and where storms are
more frequent and dreadful than on the ocean. It
is necessary to anchor every night at the spot where
they come to ; and on the most moderate days a
pilot must go to sound theivay for the ship. After
having reached within three leagues of the city,
the ships are obliged to put their goods on board
some light vessel, and to go to refit and wait for
their cargoes at Icunado de Barragan, situated
seven or eight leagues below. Here we meet with
the merchants of Europe and [[Peru]] ; but no regular
fleet comes here, as to the other parts of Spanish
America; two, or at most three, register ships,
make the whole of their regular intercourse with
Europe. The returns are chiefly gold and silver
of Chile and Peru, sugar, and hides. Those who
have now and then carried on a contraband trade
to this city, have found it more advantageous than
any other whatever. The benefit of this contra-
band has been of late wholly in the hands of the
Portuguese, who keep magazines for that purpose
in such parts of Brazil as lie near this country.
The most valuable commodities come here to be
exchanged for European goods, such as Vigona
wool tromPeru, copper from Coquimbo, gold from
Chile, and silver from Potosi. From the towns of
Corientes and Paraguay, the former 230, the latter

500 leagues from Buenos Ayres, are brought hither
the finest tobacco, sugars, cotton, thread, yellow
wax, and cotton cloth ; and from Paraguay, the
herb so called, and so highly valued, being a kind
of tea drank all over S. America by the better sort ;
which one branch is computed to amount to
1,000,000 of pieces of eight annually, all paid in
goods, no money being allowed to pass here.
Azara asserts, that the wheat here produces 16 for
1, at Monte Video 12, and at Paraquay 4. The
wheat is considerably smaller than that of Spain ;
but the bread extrernel3^ good. The average quan-
tity produced is 219,300 Janegas of Castile, 70,000
of which are consumed in the country, and the rest
exported to the Havanah, Paraguay, [[Brasil|Brazil]]s, and
the island of [[St]]. Maurice. Bread is, however, by
no means the stalF of bfe in this country ; meat,
and the great variety of roots and other grains with
which the country abounds, afford to the poor in-
habitants an equally healthy and even more nutri-
tious sustenance. Mendoza, situated at the foot of
the Andes of Chile, annually furnishes 3313 bar-
rels of wine, and St.John’s 7942 of brandy, to
Buenos Ayres and Monte Video ; but the low lands
of [[Peru]], particularly the valley of Pisco, possesses
the best vine and olive grounds that are to be
found in the s. continent. The commerce be-
tween Peru and Buenos Ayres is chiefly for cattle
and mules, to an immense value. When the Eng-
lish had the advantage of the asiento contract,
Negro slaves were brought hither by factors, and
sold to the Spaniards. Goods are conveyed in
carts over the pampas of Buenos Ayres to Mendoza
in one month. From thence they cross over the
cordilleras of Chile on mules to San Jago, a dis-
tance of 80 leagues, and thence in carts to Valpa-
raiso, 30 leagues, which journey is performed in
15 days. The climate is here healthy, provisions
and cattle abundant ; and when the projected road
is established through Villarica to the port of Tal-
cahuano in the S. seas, the conveyance will be
shortened one-third, and the precarious passage of
the cordilleras, which can only be made during the
summer months, in consequence of the snows, will
be avoided. Buenos Ayres is therefore a good na-
tural deposit for Chile, Peru, and Potosi.

1,000,000 of hides annually, and the meat of
250,000 oxen, sufficing for the consumption of its
inhabitants and its exports ; the remainder was of
consequence lost, for besides the tallow, the tongue
was the only part cured. We are glad to find
that the enterprise of some individuals has induced
them to salt some of this waste beef, and that the
British government, in case of need, may here per- J
