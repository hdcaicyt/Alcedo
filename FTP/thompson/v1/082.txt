clothing and household furniture of these Indians
consists of the skins of the beasts of the mountains :
altliough they have abundance of vines, they are
very sober, from their ignorance in what manner
to make use of them, and commonly drink nothing
but water; they are accustomed to give their
male children the names of the enemies they have
conquered, or of some hostile settlement which
they have plundered and burnt : they maintain
the strictest faith in war ; nor are they excited to
this by a slight pretext, neither through a spirit of
avarice or of conquest, but only when they are
obliged for their own defence, or for the just satis-
faction of injuries received. These Indians have
never known the barbarous method of poisoning
their arrows ; they treat their prisoners with hu-
manity, and their wives and children in the same
manner as their servants: some assert that they
are very long-lived, and that it is common for
them to reach a century ; they adore the sun, to
which they sing hymns every morning and even-
ing ; but at present they have a religion, which is
a mixture of their own with the catholic and some
protestant sects, [The Apalaches are emigrant
Indians from West Florida, from off the river
whose name they bear ; came over to Red river
about the same time the Boluxas did, and have
ever since lived on the river, above Bayau
Rapide. No nation has been more highly esteem-
ed by the French inhabitants, no complaints
against them are ever heard. There are only 14
men remaining, who have their own language, but
speak French and Mobilian.]

==[[Apalaches]]==, a bay on the coast of this pro-
vince, discovered by the Governor Hernando de
Soto, in 1535, from whence the Spaniards after-
wards formed a settlement called San Marcos,
which was immediately reduced to a miserable
village of Indians : before its cession, together
with the province, to the English in the peace of
Versailles, in 1763, it had a fort manned by a
detachment of the garrison of San Agustin. Seven-
ty-four leagues from the bay of Carlos.

country of the Seminole Indians, in E. Florida, near
the n.w. source of Great Satilla river; runs s. w.
through the Apalachy country into the bay of
Apalachy, in the gulf of Mexico, about 15 miles
below St. Mark’s. It runs about 135 miles, and

Gulge Confederacy|Apalachicola is likewise the name of the

tram. It is, says he, sacred to peace ; no cap-
tives are put to death, or human blood spilt here ;
and when a general peace is proposed, deputies
from all the towns in the confederacy meet here to
deliberate. On the other hand, the Great Coweta
Town, 12 miles higher up the Chata-Uche river,
is called the Bloody Town, where the Micos chiefs
and warriors assemble when a general war is pro-
posed ; and there captives and state malefactors
are put to death. Apalachicola is situated a mile
and an half above the ancient* town of that name,
which was situated on a peninsula formed by the.
doubling of the river, but deserted on account of
inundations. The town is about three days jour-
ney from Tallassee, a town on the Tallapoose
river, a branch of the Mobile river. See Coweta
and Tallassee.]
