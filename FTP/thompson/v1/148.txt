cotton, tobacco, cazave, and indigo ; is s. of the
island of [[St]]. Martin, and n. of that of St. Chris-
topher. Its trees of the highest estimation are tlic
soap or aloe^ the calebacl', the canapia, from which
a gum of excellent cathartic qualities is extracted,
and the the branches of which growing

downwards, afterwards turn up, thus causing an
impenetrable barrier or defence to any one at-
tacked. The coast is full of other trees, which
are called marine trees, the branches of which
entangle themselves one amongst the other. In this
island breeds the star of the sea, ( estrelladd mar)^
and the bee of the sea, (abejadel mar)., and a
great variety of birds. There is also found here a
species of lime-stone, which is carried into the
other islands. [They have plenty of lignura-vit;e
and iron wood. Its shores are dangerous, and the
approaching them requires a good pilot ; but it has
an excellent harbour, in which ships of any size
are sheltered from all winds. Half its inhabitants
are Irisli Roman Catholics, whose predecessors
settled here in 1666 ; the others are French, to
whom the island lately belonged. It was ceded
by France to the crown of Sweden in 1785. They
depend on the skies for wafer, which they keep in
cisterns. It was a nest for privateers when in the
hands of the French, and at one time had 50
British prizes in its harbour. It was for a short
time possessed by the English, having been taken
by two privateers of that nation in 1746, but was
restored to the French by the treaty of Aix-la-Cha-
pelle. Lat. 17° 53' w. Long. 62° 54' ty.]
