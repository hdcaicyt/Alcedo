vernment of S. Juan de Los Llanos in the Nuevo

city of S. Martin del Puerto. It is poor and
■wretched, of a very scorching temperature, and,
as such, produces only maize, yucas^ and plan-
tains. Immediately by it, the regulars of the
abolished company of Jesuits had a noble and rich
estate. In its district is found abundance of the
herb escorzoneza (viper’s grass).

==[[Apichiqui|APICHIQUI]]==, a barbarous nation of Indians,
of the kingdom of [[Quito]], on the coast of the S.
sea, and to the s. e. of that city. It is compre-
hended in the government of [[Mainas]], and was sub-
jected and united to the empire of [[Peru]] by the Inca
Huainacapac, thirteenth Emperor.

alcaldia mayor of [[Valladolid]], in the province and
bishopric of Mechoacan. It contains 30 families

its head settlement, and 27 from the capital.

==[[Apolabamba|APOLABAMBA]]==, a province of [[Peru]], bounded
by the province of Moxos to the e. and Carabaya
to the w. It extends about 80 leagues from s. w.
to n. e. and in this space are situate the settlements
consisting of the missions of Apolabamba, founded
and governed by the monks of San Francisco, of
the province of San Antonio de Charcas. Of these
settlements there are eight, and the number of their
inhabitants, including both sexes and all ages,
may amount to 3000. The country is moantain-
ous, intersected with hills, rocks, and precipices ;
the road, consequently is very rugged from the
settlement of Buenavista to the pleasant valley ; in
going to which, are three descents, called, from
steepness, the Attempts, (las Tentaciones), the last
being the most difficult. This territory has many
rivers, the most considerable of which is the Tui-
du. Many idioms are spoken in the aforesaid

provinces, the inhabitants being a mixture of diffe-
rent nations, namely, the Ucluipiamohas, Lecos,
Yubamonas, and Poromonas. The fruits which
they cultivate are yucus, rice, maize, camoteSy
maniy and plantains, which are the common ali-
ment of all the settlements : they likewise cul-
tivate cotton, of which they make body linen for
themselves : they collect some wax, which the
bees deposit in the trunks of trees ; and in the
pa?npas or llanos of Isllamas, some cacao, which
is produced without any other trouble or culture
than such as nature may afford. The trees here
are very numerous ; of these are the guayacanesy
cedars, marias, &c. If it be not put a stop to
soon, these woods will be filled with monkeys of
every tribe ; these animals are very mischievous,
and, in order to gratify their appetites, pick off
all the buds from the trees. On the moun-
tains are several wild beasts and venomous animals,
insects, and grubs. In every settlement, two al-
caldes are appointed by the missions, for its poli-
tical government, and these appointments are
confirmed by the viceroy of [[Peru]]. The produc-
tions that have been before stated as peculiar to it,
are carried for sale to La Paz, and to other
parts, the products of which, whether they may
have been sold or exchanged, are sufficient for the
necessary subsistence of the Indians, and of the
missionaries and the churches. The larger cattle,
the flesh of which alone is here tasted, are provid-
ed from the provinces of Lampa and Asangaro ;
and with the two settlements of Thumapasa and
Isllamas, the last of the province of [[Moxos]], it
barters cacao for other goods. The entrance to
this province is through the settlement of Pelechu-
co, from that of Lareeaxa.
