[ever, abandoned by its new possessor. In 1781
the Bahama islands were surrendered to the
Spaniards, and restored to the British by treaty at
the end of the war. Previous, however, to the
notification of the treaty. New Providence and its
forts were recovered by means of a very gallant
and well-conducted enterprise, under the com-
mand of Lieutenant-colonel Deveaux of the S.
Carolina militia. After the termination of the
American war, many of the British loyalists, and
other planters, repaired to the Bahamas, chiefly
from the s. states of N. America, from which pe-
riod most of the principal islands began to be re-
gularly settled and inhabited.

==[[Productions]]==. — The chief article which has been
cultivated in this colony is cotton ; and for several
years with very considerable success, though for
some time past that success has greatly diminish-
ed, owing probably to the natural barrenness of
the soil, and perhaps to the rains being less fre-
quent from the woods, from many parts of these hav-
ing been much cut down. The cultivation of sugar
has been attempted, (particularly on the Caicos),
but with little success. Coffee has been raised on
several of the islands. Provisions, such as Gui-
nea and Indian corn, yams, sweet potatoes, plan-
tains, cassava, Indian and pigeon peas, grow in
abundance. Most of the tropical fruits are found
here ; oranges, lemons, limes, shaddocks, pine-
apples, cocoa nuts, &c. &c. &c. Cattle and
sheep thrive on most of the islands ; and the shores
and creeks of all the Bahamas abound in turtle,
and excellent fish of various sorts. Wild ducks,
snipes, pelicans, gualdings, wild pigeons, flamin-
goes, and a variety of other birds, abound among
the islands ; and among the woods are found wild
hogs, agoutis^ guanas^ land crabs, &c. Am-
bergris is frequently found cast ashore upon the
coast. Various sorts of timber and dye Woods
are found growing in the Bahamas, such as maho-
gany, (generally of a small and very hard sort,
commonly called Madeira and horse-flesh maho-
gany), brazilletto, fustick, lignum- vitae, Spanish
oak, or black gregory, tamarind, lana wood, iron
wood, wild cinnamon, pimento, or naked wood,
yellow saunders, satin wood, pines, cedars, and
many others adapted for building small vessels,
and well calculated for the purposes of the mecha-
nic and cabinet-maker.

==[[The principal and most valuable article which
has]]==, perhaps, of late years been exported from
the Bahamas, is salt. In many of the islands
there are valuable natural salt-ponds, to which the

attention of the inhabitants has been much direct-
ed, and for the subdivision and management of
which, legislative and colonial regulations have
been enacted. In dry and favourable seasons great
quantities of salt are produced from these ponds,
and exported by the Americans to the United
States.

==[[Many Of The Small Vessels Of The Bahamas Are
Not Only Employed As Drogging (Or Carrying) Ves 
Sels Among The Different Islands|Many of the small vessels of the Bahamas are
not only employed as drogging (or carrying) ves-
sels among the different islands]]==, and in catching
turtle, but also among the numerous passages,
(particularly towards the Horida stream), in watch-
ing for wrecked vessels. They are licenced for
this purpose by the governor of the Bahamas.
Many valuable lives are saved by the exertions of
these vessels, and much property secured for the
owners and insurers of the ships employed in the
West India trade, and those bound from Vera
Cruz and the Havanah to Europe.

==[[Government And Statistics |Government and Statistics]]==. — The colonial esta-
blishment of the Bahamas is similar to that of the
other West India islands, consisting of a governor,
a lieutenant-governor, a council, and a legislative
assembly. The following islands send represen-
tatives to the house of assembly ; New providence,
and the town of Nassau, eight-; Harbour island,
three ; Eleuthera, three ; Abaco, three ; St. Sal-
vador, one ; Long island, two ; Exuma, three ;
Andros island, two ; Crooked island, one ;
Watling’s island, one; Caicos, one; Turk’s
island, two. The courts of justice are similar also
to those established in the rest of the West India
colonies. There are four regular ports of entry
in the Bahamas, viz. at New Providence, Great
Exuma, at the Caicos, and at Turk’s islands.
Besides the usual garrison at New Providence,
there is a militia established in several of the islands.
Previous to May 1803, lands were granted by the
crown in the whole of the Bahamas, to the amount
of 265,38 1 acres, for the purpose of cultivation.
The population at that time amounted to about
14,318, including 11,395 blacks and people of
colour ; and it appears by a return to the house of
commons in 1805, at a medium of two years to
1803, the number of slaves imported amounted to
2523, of whom 2230 were exported ; leaving a
remainder of only 293 for the use of the colony.
