==[[Coc Ha|CocHA]]==, another, of the province and govern-
ment of Tucuman, of the jurisdiction of the city
of Cordoba ; situate on the shore of the river Se-
gundo.

==[[Cochabamba|COCHABAMBA]]==, a province and corregU
miento of [[Peru]] ; bounded n. by the cordillera of the
Andes, e. by the heiglits of Intimuyo, e. by the
province of [[Misque]], s. by that of Chayanta or
Charcas, s. w. by the corregimiento of [[Oruro]], w.
and n. w. by that of Cicasica. It is 40 leagues in
length from n. to s. and 32 in width. This pro-
vince may with justice -be called the granary of
Peru, since it produces an abundance of every kind
of seed, through the mildness of its climate. In
the higher parts are bred a tolerable quantity of
large and small kinds of cattle. It is watered by
several small rivers of sweet water, which fertilize
the valleys ; and in these are some magnificent
estates. Almost all these small rivers become
united in the curacy of Capinota ; and their wa-
ters, passing through the provinces of Misque and
Charcas, become incorporated in the large river
which passes on the e. side of Santa Cruz de la
Sierra. In former times some mines were worked
here, and from 1747, forward, great quantities of
gold have been extracted from the lavaderos, or
washing-places, upon the heights of Choqueca-
mata, although this metal is not now found there
in the same abundance. Some veins of it are, how-
ever, to be seen in the cordillera, although these
render but little emolument. The greatest com-
merce carried on in this province depends upon its
own productions ; and the market-place of the
valley of Arque is so stocked with articles as to
have the appearance of a continual fair. It has
also some glass kilns, as it abounds greatly in glass-
wort ; likewise many sugar estates, and streams of
hot waters. Its repartirniento used to amount to
186,675 dollars, and its alcavala to 1493 dollars
per annum. Its inhabitants may amount to 70,000;
and these are divided into 17 curacies, two others
being annexed. The capital is the town of Oro-
pcsa, and the rest are,

==[[I Inhabited By A Hardy|I Inhabited by a hardy]]==, sober, and active race,
Cochabamba (as Azara observes) has risen of late

years to a considerable state of prosperity in the
manufactory of glass, cotton, &c. with which, du-
ring the late war, it has supplied the whole inte-
rior. Blessed with fertility and a moderate cli-
mate, it bids fair to be the Manchester of [[Peru]], for
1,000,000 pounds of cotton are already annually
consumed in its manufactures. Its surface abounds
in a variety of salts and mineral productions, and
its forests teem with woods and roots for dyeing.
To these Haenke has particularly turned his atten-
tion, and has pointed out, besides several new ma-
terials for manufacture, other processes for dyeing,
worthy of our adoption in Europe. This pro-
vince joined the new government of [[Buenos]] Ayres
in September 1810. See La Pcata.]
