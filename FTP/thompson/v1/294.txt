those which form its ditferent mouths : also the
island of its name, inhabited by the Guaranos In-
dians.

==[[Capuxa|CAPUXA]]==, a small settlement of the jurisdiction
and alcaldia mayor of [[Ixmiquilpan]], and of the ca-
pital of Orizava, in [[Nueva España]].

==[[Caqueta|CAQUETA]]==, a very large and abundant river
rising in the province of [[Sucumbios]] in the kingdom
of Quito, in the mountains of Mocoa, this name
being also given to it: it runs from re. to e. On
the s. it gathers the waters of tlie San Pedro, Santa
Cruz, and Arevalo, and on the n. those of the
Lucia, Pato, Tango, Tabaquero, Cascabeles,
Iscanze, and others of an inferior description. It
divides itself into two arms, the one of which takes
the name of A'^upura, and which, running nearly to
the same point as the Marahon, separates itselfinto
other branches, which enter into this latter river in
4° of lat. and immediately become as large and
considerable as if they were the main stream : the
oilier arm is also divided into two, the one taking
a n. e. course, and entering the Orinoco, and the
other running s. e. and bearing the name of the Rio
Negro ; by means of which, in the year 1744, some
Portuguese came from Maranon to Orinoco, and
proved the communication of these rivers, which
before was doubted : also by one of the arms of the
Yupura, Gonzalo Ximenes de Quesada found his
way to the new kingdom of [[Granada]] when he
undertook its conquest. Some maintain that this
river Avas the Orinoco, and thus has Don Pedro
Maldonado represented it in his map published in
the year 1750; but that of the Father Bernado
Rosella, missionary of the abolished society of the
Jesuits in Orinoco, made after the notes and in-
structions of the Father Manuel Roman, atiributcs
Avilli some confidence another origin to the Orinoco,
and speaks of the Caqueta as one of the riA^ers Avhich
enter it on the w. side.'" The Spanish geographer
Cruz, in his General Chart of America, makes no
distinction bctAveen the Yupura and the Caqueta,
and only speaks of one stream, which runs con-
tinually to the s.s. e. through the territory of the Ca-
vauris Indians, before it enters the Maranon. He
delineates the same as throwing out four branches
to the w. and three to the e. all Avhich join the latter
river ; and he further states, that before it becomes
thus divided, it forms on its n. side tAvo large lakes
called Ynabavh and Cumapi ; from the av hole of
Avhich may be easily inferred how great is the
abundance of its wafers.

==[[Carab Al A|CARABAlA]]==, a province and corregimiento of
[[Peru]], bounded on the e. by Larecaja, w. by Quis-
picanchi, n, w. and n. by the territories of tiie
infidel Indians, called Carangues, Sumachuanes,
and others, who are separated by the famous river
Inambary; s. w. by the province of [[Canes]] and
Caliches or Tinta, and s. by Lampa and Asangaro^
and in part by Puno or Paucarcolla. According {o
the nice measurements Avhich were made Avith re-
gard to this province as Avell as of the others, it is
said to be 40 leagues from n. to s. and 50 at the
most from e. to w. Its fnrtherest limits are only 14
leagues distant from Cuzco, althoush on horseback
it is necessary to go around of 60 leagues. Its
climate is various, according to the more or less
elevated situation of the country; so that it is in
some parts very cold, and in others more temperate.
The pastures are good, consequently there is no
Avant of cattle, and in the neighbourhood of the
Andes they gather three or four crops of coca in
the year. In this province is included that called
San Gaban, which was united to it; many settle-
ments having been at the same time added to the
provinces of Larecaja, Lampa and Asangaro. It
has abounded more in gold than any other province
