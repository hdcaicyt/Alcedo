==[[Anna]]==, a cape or point of land of the coast of
New England, in the province and colony of [[Mas]]-
sachusetts. It runs many leagues into the sea, be-
tween the river Pennycook and Port Boston. [It
forms the n. side of Massachusetts bay, as cape

==[[Annaciois|ANNACIOIS]]==, or Annacous, a barbarous na-

vince and captainship of [[Puerto]] Seguro. They
inhabit the woods and mountains to the w. near the
rivers Grande and Yucaru. They are constantly
in a state of warfare, night and day, and are irre-
concilable enemies of the Portuguese, whose colo-
nies and cultivated lands they continually infest,
and which they destroyed in 1687.

==[[Annapolis|ANNAPOLIS]]==, Real, a city and bay of the
province and colony of [[Nova]] Scotia. It was the
capital until this was translated to Halifax, since
itAvas but small and badly fortified. It was found-
ed, with the name of Severn, by the relics of an
army established here in the time of Queen Anne of
England, on the shore of an excellent bay towards
the w. The French established themselves here in
the year 1605, under the command of Mr. Pointis,
who came from the island of [[Santa]] Cruz with a
certain number of colonists. He gave it the name
of Port Royal ; but the English, headed by co-
lonel Nicholson, drove them from the poif. This
port, besides being covered with the thickest clouds,
is of difficult ingress and egress. Ships can make
it only at one certain period of the year, and then
but Avith great precaution ; the currents here being
so rapid, as generally to drive them stern foremost ;
but indeed, if it were not for this, it w^ould be one
of the best ports in the world. It is two leagues in
length, and has a small island, called the island of
Goats, almost opposite the middle of the quay. It is
of a good depth, and Avell sheltered from every Avind.
When it belonged to the French, the ships employed
hi the whale fisheries used to put in here ; but this
commerce is at present wanting, since the English

rather prefer Port Breton. The city, although
small, has some beautiful edifices, but of moderate
height. The English destroyed the old fortifica-
tion, and constructed another of a regular form,
with four bastions, a deep ditch, a covered Avay, a
counterscarp, a half-moon, and other exterior
works detached from the body of the fortified
place, all of A\ hich excite in the Indians re\xren-
tial aAve. It has also difi'erent batteries conveniently
placed to repel the attacks of an enemy, Avho can
only hope to carry it by bombardment. This
fortified place appears to be the battery of New
England, and is the last to impede the invasion of
the French or Indians on the e. as well by sea as
land. Not far from the port is a point of land,
lying between tAvo riAmrs, Avhere the tide falls 10
or 12 feet, and all around are beautiful meadows,
which are thronged with all kinds of birds. Its
principal commerce consists in skins, Avhich they
exchange with the Indians for European manufac-
tures. It is the residence of a governor, and is
garrisoned by SOO men. At the beginning of this
century it was, amongst the French, the very Dun-
kirk of America, serving as an asylum for pirates
and cruisers, to the ruin of commerce and the
fisheries. [The harbour is two leagues in length
and one in breadth, and the small island, before
referred to, is almost in the middle of the basin,
Avhicli is said to be large enough to contain
several hundred ships. Its depth of water is no
where less than four or fi\m fathoms ; it being
six or seven on one side of the island, and on the
other 16 or 18. The toAvn is not large, but has
some very handsome buildings. It is fortified ;
nor can it be easily attacked but by a bombard-
ment. The fort is capable of containing about
100 men in its present state.] Long. 65° 22'.

==[[Annapolis]]==, Real, a capital city of the coun-
ty of Ann Arundel, in the province and colony of
Maryland, at the mouth of the Severn, and was, by
an act of the Assembly in 1694, declared a maritime
city, it being ordained that it should be the resi-
dence of a collector and commandant of the ma-
rine ; from which time it began to take the name of
Annapolis. Hither also was transferred the tribu-
nal of the county, together with all the state
papers, acts, and other important documents ;
the parish church was erected in 1699, and a pub-
lic school was founded agreeably to an act of {Fe
Assembly, having the archbishop for its chancel-
lor. Procurators, visitors, and governors Asere
also appointed to preside in this city, though tbw
establishment failed to answer the wise purpose?
of its creation. The aforesaid tribunal meets, m
