Fortune island), are tlie principal, Castle island
(a very small one) is the most s. and is situated at
the s. end of Acklin’s island, which is the largest
of the group, and extends about 50 miles in length ;
atthew. extremity it is seven miles in breadth,
but grows narrow towards the s. N. Crooked
island is upwards of 20 miles long, and from two to
six broad; Long Key, about two miles in length,
l)ut very narrow : on this latter island is a valuable
salt pond. Near Bird rock, which is the most
w, extremity of the group, and at the w. point of
N. Crooked island, is a reef harbour, and a good
anchorage ; a settlement has been lately established
there, called Pitt’s Town, and this is the place
where the Jamaica packet, on her return to Eu-
rope through the Crooked island passage, leaves
once every month the Bahama mail from England,
and takes on board the mail for Europe ; a port of
entry is now established there. There is likewise
very good anchorage, and plenty of fresh water at
the French w'ells, which lie at the bottom of the
bay, about half-way between Bird rock and thes.
end of Long Key. There is also a good harbour,
(called Atwood’s harbour) at the w. end of Acklin’s
island, but fit only for small vessels, and another
at Major’s Keys, on the n. side of N, Crooked
island, for vessels drawing eight or nine feet water.
