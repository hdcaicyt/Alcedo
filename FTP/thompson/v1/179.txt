==[[This beautiful bridge exceeds the other as much
in elegance as in length]]==, and cost the subscribers
76,700 dollars. Both bridges have draws for the
admission of vessels, and lamps for the benefit of
evening passengers. Seven free schools are sup-
ported here at the public expence, in which the
children of every class of citizens may freely asso-
ciate together. The number of scholars is comput-
ed at about 900, of which 160 are taught Latin,
&c. There are besides these many private schools.
The principal societies in the commonwealth hold
their meetings in this town, and are, the marine
society, American academy of arts and sciences,
Massachusetts agricultural society, Massachusetts
charitable society, Boston Episcopal charitable
.society, Massachusetts historical society, society
for propagating the gospel, Massachusetts congre-
gational society, medical society, humane society,
Boston library society, Boston mechanic associa-
tion, society for the aid of emigrants, charitable
lire society, and seven respectable lodges of free
and accepted masons. The foreign and domestic
trade of Boston is very considerable, to support
w hich there are three. banks, viz. the branch ot the
L^nited States bank, the Union, and the Massa-
chusetts bank ; the latter consists of 800 shares of
500 dollars, equal to 400,000; the capital of the
Union bank is 1,200,000 dollars, 400,000 of which
are the property of the state. In 1784 the entries
of foreign and coasting vessels were 372, and the
clearances 450. In 1794 the entries from foreign
ports were 567. In 1795 these entries amounted
to 725, of which the siiips were 96, barques 3,
snows 9, polacre 1, brigs 185, dogger I, schooners
362, shallop 1, and sloops 65. To the principal
manufactures, above enumerated, we may add
loaf-sugar, beer, sail-cloth, cordage, wool, and
cotton cards, playing cards, pot and pearl ashes,
paper hangings, plate, glass, tobacco, and cho-
colate. There are SO distilleries, two breweries,
eight sugar-houses, and eleven rope-walks.

==[[Eight years ago]]==, the intercourse with the country
barely required two stages and twelve horses, on
the great road between this and New Haven, dis-
tant 164 miles ; whereas there are now 20 car-
riages and 100 horses employed. The number
of the different stages that run through the week
from this town is upwards of 20 ; about 10 years
ago there were only three. Attempts have been
made to change the government of the town from
its present form to that of a city, but this mea-
sure, not according with the democratic spirit of
the people, has as yet failed. At an annual meet-
ing in March, nine select men are chosen for the
government of (he town ; at the same time are
chosen a town-clerk, a treasurer, 12 overseers of
the poor, 24 fire wards, 12 clerks of the market,
12 scavengers, 12 constables, besides a number
of other officers. If the inhabitants do not reap
all the advantages they have a right to expect from
their numerous officers, it is said that it is not for
want of wholesome laws for the regulation of the
weights, measures, and quality of provisions, or
other branches of police, but because the laws
are not put in execution. Besides those called
trained bands, there are four other military com-
panies in Boston, viz. the ancient and honourabie
artillery company, the cadets, fusileers, and
artillery. The ancient and honourable artillery
company was incorporated in 1638, and the elec-
tion of a captain and officers of it for the year is on
the first Monday in June annually, which is ob-
served here as a day of festivity. Several officers
in the American array, who signalized themselves
in the late war, received their first knowledge of
tactics in this military school. Boston was called
Shaumut by the Indians; Trimountain by the
settlers in Charlestown, from the view of its three
hills ; and had its present name in token of respect
to the Rev. Mr. Cotton, a minister of Boston in
England, and aiterwards minister of the first
church here. Boston has suffered severely by
numerous fires, the houses being mostly built of
wood. The last large fire happened July 30,
1794, and consumed 96 houses, rope-walks, &c.
and the account of losses given in by the sufferers
amounted to 209,861 dollars. Boston ffe's a
pride in having given birth to Benjamin Franklin,
and a number of other patriots, who Avere among
the most active and influential characters in effect-
ing the revolution.]
