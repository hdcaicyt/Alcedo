==[[Andes|ANDES]]==, Cordillera de los, a chain of
mountains and most lofty serra7iias, which extend
over nearly the whole of America, for the space of
more than 1000 leagues, running continually from
n. to s. from the province of [[Santa]] Marta, where
they have their origin, in the Sierra Nevada, of the
new kingdom of [[Granada]], through the provinces

6f [[Peru]] and Chile, as far as the straits of Magellan
and cape Horn, where they terminate. They are
divided into two branches ; one Avhich passes
through the interior of the new kingdom of [[Gra]]-
nada, on the s. part of the plains of San Juan,
beginning in Guayana ; and tlie other which forms
various lines and curves, divided in difteient direc-
tions, through Cuzco, Tucuraan, Tarma, and Pa-
raguay, and afterwards becomes united with the
grand chain of mountains of [[Brasil|Brazil]]. It takes its
course through the isthmus of Panama into the
kingdom of Nicaragua, passes into those of Gua-
temala, Mechoacan, and the province of [[Cfinaloa]],
and continues itself through the unknoivn countries
of N. Americak These mountains arc clad with
immense forests, and their tops are continually
covered Avith snows, from the melting of Avhich
are formed great lakes, and the largest rivers in
the world. Their greatest elevation is in the
kingdom of Quito, where the lofty Chimborazo
rises superbly among the rest ; it has many volca-
noes vomiting fire, and which have caused infinite
mischief in the provinces, producing earthquakes,
inundations, and scattering, far and Avide, mud,
bitumen, and burning stones : in its entrails are hid-
den the greatest treasures of nature, such as gold,
silver, and other metals, precious stones, marbles,
and mineral earths of the rarest and most esteemed
qualities. Almost all the mines in the bosom of
these rich mountains are worked, and principally
those of Peru and Chile. Besides the name of
Andes, they bear others also, given to them by the-
various settlements in their vicinities. The roads
which, upon their account, were made by the
Incas, Emperors of Peru, were truly magnificent ;
but they are at present destroyed, and those wliich
are used now for the communication of the inte-
rior provinces, may be called precipices rather
than roads, and are only passable on foot, or oji
mules, which are very tractable and safe. These
mountains are inhabited by many barbarous and
fierce nations, and they abound in mineral Avaters
of approved medicinal virtues. The greatest width
of these mountains is 20 leagues, being in some
parts 12 leagues from the sea-coast, and in others
approaching to it within five leagues. They
abound in vicunas, guanacos, monkeys, and apes of
infinite kinds, tigers, leopards, and SAvine, Avho
have the navel in the spine and smell of musk,
with a multitude of other curious birds and ani-
mals, altogether unknoAvn in Europe ; such is the
condor, in the kingdom of Chile, Avhich is a car-
nivorous bird of an extraordinary size, having the
power to carry with it up into the air animals of
considerable weight, such as sheep, and even small
