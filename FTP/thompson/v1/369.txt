and pleasantly situated. Before the deslrnction of
til is town by the British in 1775, several brandies
of mannfadures were carried on to great advan-
* tage, some of which have been since revived : par-
ticularly tlic manufacture of pot and pearl ashes,
ship-building, rum, leather in all its branches,
silver, tin, brass, and pewter. Three rope-walks
have lately been erected in this town, and tlie in-
crease of its houses, population, trade, and naviga-

==[[Cii Aii Lestown|CiiAiiLESTOWN]]==, another city of the island of
Nevis, one of the Caribes, in the Antilles ; in w Inch
there are beautiful houses and shops well provided
with every thing ; is defended by a fort called
Charles. It has a market every Saturday, begin-
ning at sun-rise and finishing at mid-day, whither
the Negroes bring 'maize, names, garden-herbs,
fruits, &c. In the parish of San Juan is a piece
of sulphureous land, in the upper extremity of an
opening of the land, called Solfatara, or Sulphur
gut, which is so hot as to be telt through the soles
of the shoes when being trodden upon. At the
foot of the declivity of this same part of the city,
is a small hot stream, called the Bath, which being
supposed to rise from the aforesaid spot, loses itself
shortly in the sand. Towards the side lying next
the sea are two fountains, one of hot water, the
other of cold, and of these two are formed the lake
of Blackrock, the waters of which are of a moderate
warmth, and which lies to the n. of the city, being
nearly a quarter of a mile’s distance from the place
where are caught eels and silver-fish, resembling
the cod and slimgut in flavour, the latter of which
lias a head disproportioned to its body. [A prodi-
gious piece ol Nevis mountain falling down in an
earthquake several years ago, left a large vacuity,
which is still to be seen. The altitude of this
mountain, taken by a quadrant from Charlestown
bay, is said to be a mile and a half perpendicular ;
and from the said bay to the top, four miles. The
declivity from this mountain to the town is very
steep half-way, but afterwards easy of ascent.] In
