==[[Aconcagua|ACONCAGUA]]==, a province and corregimiento
of the kingdom of [[Chile]] ; bounded n. by a part
of the province of [[Quillota]], e, by the Cordillera,
s. by the valley of Colina, of the jurisdiction of
Santiago, w. by the province of Quillota. Its
territory is level and well watered. It is divided
into two parts by a large river of the same name,
having a bridge built of stone and mortar, w ith
two arches. It produces abundance of wheat and
much wild marjoram, which is carried to [[Peru]],
and forms the principal branch of its commerce.
In this province is the royal road, lying through
the Cordillera in the way to Mendoza, which is
very rough and dangerous, on account of the
many slopes and steep declivities towards the river ;
the path is very narrow, and in various places it is
necessary to open a pass by means of a pick-axe ; so
that, if at any time the mules should crowd together,
they would push each other into the river, w hich has
not unfrequently been the case. The royal treasures
are carried by this road from the month of Novem-
ber to April and part of May. A few years since,
some small houses of brick and mortar have been
built on one or other side of the Cordillera, which
they call casuchas (miserable huts) ; in these they
put, in the winter time, some coal, biscuit, and
hung beef, so that the couriers, providing them-
selves with the keys of the doors at Mendoza, or, on
the other side, at the Guardia of Aconcagua, may
have something to live upon, incase they should
be stopt by a fall of snow on their journey ; and
with this precaution, a courier goes every month
to Santiago, carrying with him the mails brought
by the ships from Europe. In the winter it is
customary to walk on foot over the snow, from
Paramillo, which is three leagues from the top of
the Cordillera, and four from its descent to tlie
place which is called Los Ojos de Agua, through
the valley of Putaendo ; but towards the ??. there
is another way, which they call De Los Patos,
which is the road generally taken in going to the
city of San Juan ; but the Cordillera being more
lofty here, it is only passable in the months of
February and March. The inhabitants of this
province amount, on an average, to 8000 souls.
The capital' is San Felipe el Real. [Lat. 32° II'
