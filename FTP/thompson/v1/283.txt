[==[[La Chine|La Chine]]==, eight miles above Montreal, with eight
or ten men in each canoe, their baggage, and 65
packages of goods, six cwt. of biscuit, two cwt. of
pork, three bushels of pease, for the men’s provi-
sion, two oil-cloths to cover the goods, a sail, &c.
an axe, a towing-line, a kettle, and a sponge to
bail out the water, with a quantity of gum, bark,
and watape, to repair the vessel. The voyagers
are frequently obliged to unload their canoes, and
carry their goods upon their backs, or rather sus-
pended in slings from their heads ; and this they
call a decharge. In the same case each man’s load
is two packages, though some carry three, and the
canoe is towed by a strong line. There are some
places where the ground will not admit of their
carrying the whole : they then make two trips ;
that is, leave half their lading, and go and land it
at the distance required, and then return for that
which was left. In some places both goods and
canoes are transported, and this is denominated a
portage. But there is another association establish-
ed within these few years, called the South-west
or Michillimakinak Company ; some of the part-
ners in this association have also shares in the
north-west company, but the general concern is to-
tally separate. The south-west merchants pursue
their trade across the lakes Ontario and Erie, and
down the rivers Illinois, Ohio, and Mississippi,
in the territory of the United States. In conse-
quence of the embargo which has lately taken
place in the United States, and which it was ap-
prehended would affect the concerns of this com-
pany, one of the partners, Mr. Gillespie, went to
Wcashington, to procure from the government a
safe conduct for their people and property em-
ployed in the trade. He was assured by Mr. Mad-
dison, that no interruption whatever should take
place in the prosecution of their trade with the In-
dians in the United States territory ; and a clause
Avas inserted to that effect in the supplementary
embargo act. Upon the return of Mr. Gillespie to
Montreal, the people with the boats, laden with the
property for trade belonging to the company, were
accordingly sent off on their usual voyage. On
the 21st of May, the first five boats arrived within
the American limits on lake Ontario ; they were
hailed from the shore by order of the commandant
of Niagara ; but having no business at that place,
the boats continued their route, when they were
immediately fired upon by the Americans. Three
of the advanced boats pulled up and escaped ; the
other two Avere brought to, and taken by the Ame-
ricans, who, finding there were several more
astern, embarked in an armed boat, went in search
of them, and captured five more, which they car-

ried to Niagara. They then sailed after the re-
mainder ; but information being given by a gentle-
man, Avho immediately armed a boat, and went to
inform them of their danger, the brigade put about
for Kingston, Avhere they arrived in safety, having
been chased for tAvo days by the American armed
boats.

17. General History. — This country was discO'
vered by the English as early as about 1497, and
settled by the French in 1608, who kept possession of
it till 1760, Avhen it was taken by the British arms ;
and at the treaty of Paris in 1763, Avas ceded by
France to the crown of England, to whom it has
ever since belonged. One of the most remarkable
accidents which history records of this country, is
the earthquake in the year 1663, Avhich over-
Avhelmed a chain of mountains of free-stone more
than 300 miles long, and changed the immense
tract into a plain. See Buitish America, and
Britain, Neav, for further particulars concerning
this country.]

[==[[Canada Creeks|Canada Creeks]]==. There are three creeks which
bear this name : one a water ot W ood creek, Avhich
it meets four or five miles n. n. zv. of fort Stanwix,
or New fort Schuyler. The other two are n.
branches of Mohawk river ; the upper one mingles
its Avaters with the Mohawk in the township of
Herkemer, on the German flats, 16 miles below Old
fort Schuyler ; over the mouth of it is a sightly and
ingeniously constructed bridge. The other emp-
ties into the Mohawk 13 miles beloAv. Both these
are long, rapid, and unnavigable streams, and
bring a considerable accession of water to the Mo-
hawk. The lands on these creeks are exceedingly
rich and valuable, and fast settling.]
