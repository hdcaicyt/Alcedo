dried flesh, hung up to preserve them from corrup-
tion. Their garments are a shirt without sleeves,
reaching down to the middle of their legs. The
married people wear drawers of baize with coloured
puckers for festival days, and those who enjoy
offices of state wear a baize jacket : they neither
use hatnorshoes, and no one of them ever goes out
without slinging round his neck some medals and a
rosary. The hair is worn short until they marry,
and when they become old they suffer it to grow
long. The women wear close gowns which reach
down to the ground, and which they call tapoyes:
they never swathe or bind themselves round the
waist, but carry on their necks, on gala-days, some
threads strung with glass intermixed with beads
made of cacao nuts, and coloured beans ; these
threads usually amount to 20 or SO rows ; on en-
tering the church they always loosen their hair.
The regulars of the company of the Jesuits taught
them offices, in which they assisted most dexte-
rously ; and it really excites admiration that In-
dians, acquainted only with their own barbarian
dialect, should be able to manage the compass of
the notes, understand their proportions and num-
bers, and apply the rules of music to its execution.
At certain times of the year they go a mdear, or
to hunt for honey among the woods : from thence
they bring back wax of two sorts, one which is
white and odoriferous, Jhe other of less substance,
as the wax of Europe, manufactured by a species
of bees without stings, called opernus; also an-
other kind of wax, made by a still different sort of
bees, but which are all properly denominated wild
wax. This wax is delivered to the curate, who
preserves it in his house to send to the provinces of
[[Peru]] ; and from the product of this article, and
from that of the cotton, which is made into woofs,
to the amount of two pounds weight yearly by
each Indian, he procures in 3xchange whatever is
necessary for the settlement, such as baizes, coloured
wools, bags, iron and steel articles, chopping
knives, wedges, hatchets, scissars, pocket-knives,
needles, medals, bugles, and other articles of hard-
ware and little necessaries, which, being stored up
by him, is distributed amongst the natives accord-
ing to their necessities, and in a manner that they
may want for nothing, but live happy and con-
tented. The settlements are as follows :

==[[San Xavier|San Xavier]]==, San Joseph,

==[[La Concepcion|La Concepcion]]==, Santiago,

==[[San Miguel|San Miguel]]==, San Juan,

==[[C H I|C H I]]==

of Sachica in the Nuevo Reyno de Granada. It
is of a cold temperature, and produces wheat,
maize, barley, papaSy and the other fruits peculiar
to its climate. Its ijihabitants are so few as scarcely
to amount to 30 housekeepers, and about the same
number of Indians. Four leagues to the n. w. of
Tunja, and somewhat less from Velez.

of the province and corregimiento of [[Piura]] in [[Peru]] ;

==[[Chire|CHIRE]]==, Santa Rosa de, a city of the govern-
ment and province of [[Los]] Llanos in the Nuevo
Reyno de Granada ; founded by the Governor
Francisco Anciso. It is of a very hot and un-
healthy temperature, but affords the same vegetable
productions as the rest of the province. It is so
mean and reduced as to contain hardly 100 house-
keepers, and scarcely deserves the name of a city.
This settlement lies the furthest to the n. w. extre-
mity of any in this kingdom, and is bounded in
that quarter by the province and bishopric of Ca-
racas.

the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, to the e. of the
mountains of Bogota, and at the entrance of the
llanos or plains of Cazanare and Meta. They
lead a wandering life through the woods in com-
pany with the Guaibas ; they are crafty and very
dexterous thieves, but of a docile and pacific dis-
position. In 16.64; some of them were reduced into
