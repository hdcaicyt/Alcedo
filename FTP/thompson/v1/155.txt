vernment of Venezuela in the kingdom of [[Tierra]]
Firme, situate near the coast, in tiie district of
Caracas, from whence it is distant six leagues to

^^yEGON^J'a^ lake of Canada, formed by the
drains of those of St. Peter and Miskouaikane, in
the country of the Chemonchovaiiistes Indians.

[==[[Behring’s Bay|BEHRING’S Bay]]==, on the n, w. coast of N.
America, is separated from Admiralty bay on
the n. hy a point of land, and lies n. w. from
Cross sound. See Admikacty Bay.]

[==[[Behring’s Straits|Behring’s Straits]]==, separate Asia from Ame-
rica, are so called from the Russian navigator.
Captain Behring, who, with Tshirikovv, sailed
from Kamptschatka in Siberia, on the Asiatic
coast, in quest of the new world, in a quarter
where it had perhaps never been approaclied.
They both discovered land within a few degrees
of the n. w. coast of [[America]]. But the more re-
cent discoveries of Captain Cook, and his succes-
sor, Clarke, have confirmed the near approxima-
tion of the two continents. Cape Prince of Wales
is the most westerly point of tlie American conti-
nent hitherto known. It is situated in lat. 65°
46' n, long. 168° 15' e. and is 39 miles distant
from the e. coast of Asia. The sea, from the
s. of Behring’s straits, to the crescent of isles be-
tween Asia and America, is very shallow. It
deepens from these straits (as the Brit ish seas do from
Dover) till soundings are lost in the Pacific ocean,
but that does not take place but to the s. of the
isles. Between them and the straits is an increase
from 12 to 54 fathoms, except only off St. Thad-
deus Noss, where (here is a channel of greater
depth. From the volcanic disposition, it has been
jmlged probable, not only that there was a separa-
tion of the continents at these straits, but that the
whole space from the isles to that small opening
had once been dry land ; and that the fury of the
watery element, actuated by that of fire, had, in
very remote times, subverted and overwhelmed
the tract, and left tlie islands to serve as monumen-
tal fragments. The famous Japanese map places
some islands seemingly within these straits, on
which is bestowed the title of Ya Zue, or the
Kingdom of the Dwarfs. This gives some reason
to suppose that America was not unknown to the
Japanese; and that they had, as is mentioned by
Kffiinpfer and Charlevoix, made voyages of dis-
covery ; and, accordijig to the last, actually
wintered upon the continent, where probably
meeting with the Esqaimaux, they might, in
comparison of themselves, and justly, distinguish
them by the name of dwarfs.]
