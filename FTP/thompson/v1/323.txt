==[[Cartagena|CARTAGENA]]==, a province and government
of the kingdom of[[Tierra Firme]], in the jurisdiction
of the Nuevo Reyno de Granada, bounded n. by
the sea, s. by the province of [[Antioquia]], e. by
the province and government of [[Santa]] Marta, from
which it is divided by the Rio Grande de la Mag-
dalena, and w. by the province of Darien, being
separated by the river San J uan ; it is 100 leagues
long, running nearly from n. e. to s. w. and 80
wide, e. w. It was discovered by Rodrigo Bas-
tidas in 1520, and subdued by the addantado or
governor Pedro de Heredia, at the expence of
many battles, owing to the valour and warlike dis-
position of the natives. This country is of a very
hot and moist temperature, full of mountains and
woods, and towards the n. part swampy, sandy,
and full of pools of sea-water, from the lowness of
the territory ; but it is at the same time fertile, and
abounds in maize, pulse, and fruits, as also in
cattle, of the hides and fat of which this province
makes a great traffic. Its mountains produce ex-
cellent woods, and the famous dyeing wood, equal
to that of Campeche, with an abundance of excel-
lent gums, medicinal balsams, and herbs. Here
are many kinds of rare birds, animals, and snakes
of different species ; amongst the former the most
remarkable are the penco, of the figure of a cat,
and so heavy that it takes a full hour to move
itself 20 paces ; the mapurito^ of the size of a small
lap-dog, whose arms and means of defending him-
self from other animals and his pursuers consist
simply in discharging some wind with such force
and noise as to stupify his enemies, whilst he
quietly makes his retreat to some neighbouring
thicket. This province produces also indigo,
tortoise-shell, and cotton, and some cacao of an
excellent quality in the Rio de la Magdalena. It
was well peopled with Indians in the time of its
gentilism, but its inhabitants are now reduced to
a very trifling number. It is watered by various
rivers, but those of the most consideration are El
Grande de la Magdalena, and thatof San Juan, or
Atracto, both of which are navigable and well
stocked with alligators, tortoises, and a multitude
of fishes. Its district contains 83 setttleraents, of

which there are two cities, seven towns, and 96
settlements or villages, inhabited by 59,233 whites,
13,993 Indians, and 7770 Negro and Mulatto
slaves, according to the numeration of the fiscal of
the royal audience of Santa Fe, Don Francisco
Moreno y Escandon, in the year 1770. The ca-
pital has the same name, and the other settlements
are.
