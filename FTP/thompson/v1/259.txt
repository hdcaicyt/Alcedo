[and vegetables, now regale the inhabitants, who
tor so many months had been confined to their
frozen provisions. The months of May and June
are often wet, sometimes greatly to the detriment
of husbandry. In the spring of 1807 the v/eather
was unusually wet, from the latter end of April
until the iOtli of June, when it cleared up, after a
most violent thunder-storm which happened on the
9th. During May, scarcely a day passed without
rain, and the weather was excessively changeable :
Fahrenheit’s thermometer was sometimes as high
as 75, and at otlier times as low as 90, in the course
of 94 hours. The farmers had not finished sow-
ing by the middle of June, though tliey in 'general
get all tlieir wheat into the srround by the 90th of
May. Some people are of opinion, that sowing
late answers best in Canada, as the ground has then
time to imbibe the heat of the sun after the snow
has melted ; and that Avheat sown in June is ripe
as soon as that sown in May. The practice of the
Canadian farmers is, however, contrary to this
theory. Thunder and lighting do not very often
visit Canada ; but when they do, their violence is
great, and damage generally ensues, 'i'he follow-
ing is a tolerable correct slateof Fahrenbeit’stherrao-

==[[The spring]]==, summer, and autumn of Canada,
are all comprised in these five montlis. The rest
of the year may be said to consist wholly of winter.
One of the greatest plagues to which the inhabitants
of Canada are subject, are the common house-flies,
which are extremely troublesome in the months of
June, July, and August. The stoves keep them alive
in Avinter, and the sun restores them to their full
vigour and power of annoying in the summer. The
sting ef the musquito, an insect abounding in all
moist or sliady situations, is trifling at first, but
the next day is extremely painful, and sometimes
dangerous, if violently rubbed. The best remedy
is to wash the part with some powerful acid, such
as lemou-juice or vinegar. Tlie brulots or sand-
flies are so very small as to be hardly ]terceptible
in their attacks, and your foreiiead will be stream-
ing with blood before you are sensible of being
amongst them. These are the only disagreeables
that are attached to a Canadian summer ; Avere it
free from them, it Avould be equal to that of any

other country in the Avorld ; but as it, is a burning
sun, house-flies, musquitos, and sand-flies, certainly
prevent the finest months of the year from being
enjoyed in full perfection. The summer of 1808
Avas the hottest that has been knoAvn for several
years in Canada. In the months of July and
August, the thermometer Avas several times at 90
and 95, and one or two days it rose to 105 in the
shade, at Montreal and the Three Rivers. At
Quebec it was 101 or 109. The fall of the year
is the most agreeable season in Canada. The sultry
Aveather is then gone, and the night frosts have en-
tirely destroyed the venomous insects, or rendered
tliern torpid.

==[[S]]==. Natural curiosities . — The face of Lower Ca-
nada is remarkably bold and striking. The noble
river St. Lawrence, flowing more than 400 miles
betAAmen high lands and lofty mountains, sometimes
divided into channels by large islands, and at other
times intersected by clusters of small ones ; nu-
merous rapid streams, rolling from the neighbour-
ing mountains, breaking over steep precipices, and
mingling tlieir Avaters with the grand river; its
bold and rugged shores, lofty eminences, and slop-
ing valleys, covered Avith tlie umbrageous foliage of
immense forests, or interspersed Avith the cultivated
settlements of the inhabitants, — present altogether to
the eye of the spectator a succession of the most
sublime and picturesque objects that imagination
can conceive. Beyond the rapids of Richlieu,
which are situate about 400 miles from the entrance
of the St. LaAvrence, the country assumes a more
level aspect; the mountains retire to the ti. and s.
as far as the eye can reach, leaving all that part of
Canada, extending to the s. w. and w. e. an almost
interminable flat. Frozen oceans, gulfs, and bays ;
immense lakes and Avildernesses, diversifled at times
by chains of enormous mountains, form the features
of the remaining part of the British settlements in
N. America, Avhich extend from tlie coast of J^a-
brador to the sea of Kamtschatka and the Pacific
ocean, and to the n. beyond the Arctic circle.
The mountain on Avhich Quebec is built, and the
high lands for several miles along the St. Lawrence,
consist chiefly of black lime slate. A fcAv moun-
tains in tlie neighbourliooil fire composed of grey
rock stone ; but they, for the most part, stand on a
bed of lime slate. About a yard from the surface
this slate is quite compact, and Avithout any cracks,
so that one cannot perceive it is a slate, its jiarticlcs
being imperceptible. It lies in strata which vary
from three or four to 90 inches thick, and upwards.
In Quebec the strata lie in some parts diaeorially,
in others almost perpendicular, but none horizon-
tally , and bear everj' mark of having been violently!
