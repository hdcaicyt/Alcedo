[==[[Arkansas|ARKANSAS]]==, or Arkensas, nn.w. branch
of Mississippi river, of a very lengthy course,
which falls in by two mouths, and forms an island.
Thirty-five miles long,.and ten broad. The branch
on the n.e. side of the island receives V/hite river,
about 24 miles from its mouth. The course of the
river Arkansas, with its meanders. Major Pike
computes at 1981 miles, from its junction with the
Mississippi (or rather the Missouri) to the moun-
tains ; and from thence to its source 192; the
total length being 2173 miles : the former portion
to the mountains may be navigated. It also re-
ceives several rivers, which are navigable for
more than 100 miles. The banks of the Arkansas
swarm with buffaloes, elks, and deer, in numbers
which seem inexhaustible by the hunting tribes.
Near the sources of this river is a prodigious
mountain, well known ^ the savages for many
hundred miles around. The altitude was observed
on a base of a mile, and found to be 10,581 feet
above the Prairie ; and admitting the Prairie to be
8000 feet above the sea, the height of this peak
would be 18,581 feet. But when our author
on this occasion mentions the peak of Teneriffe,
he forgets the authentic observations of La Crenne,
and other astronomers employed by the French
king, who have sufficiently ascertained that the
height of the peak of Tenerifl'e is only 1742 toises,
or l0,452 French feet, above the level of the sea.
It is the detached and insular situation which makes
this peak appear higher than it really is. If it
approached nearly to the height of Mont Blanc,
15,500 feet, the difficulty of the ascei.t w ould be
such, that four days would not be more than suffi-
cient to go and return ; w hereas there is no hint of
any such circumstance. But it is almost neces-
sary to apologize for any such observations on the
w ork of our enterprising traveller. One man can-
not unite every quality ; and a scientific traveller
miglit liavc perished amidst tire difficulties which
were surmounted by his courage and perseverance.
The distresses suffered by him and his companions,
amidst those mountains covered with eternal snow,
were terrible; famine daily starin2‘ them in the
face ; while their clothing was exhausted, the
blood started from under the b'sudages of their
