==[[J/As Mercedes|J/as Mercedes]]==, and an liospital for women. It
contains more than 2000 inhabitants, and amongst
these many illustrious families, descended from the
first conquerors. The Indians here are accounted
the most industrious of any in the kingdom. The
leinperaturc is mild, and it abounds in fruits and
pastures : here arc also mines of various metals. Here
it was that Atahualpa was put to death by the
Spanish, being the last Inca and Emperor of
[[Peru]] ; and there is still to be seen a stone, of a
yard and an half long and two-thirds wide, which
serves as the foundation to the altar of the chapel
where he met his fate. Of this palace, which was
for the most part built of mud, but which was very
large, and was afterwards converted into the prison,
the chapel, and house of the corregidoi\ ■called De
Cahildo, nothing has been left save a piece of wall
of about 12 yards long and eight wide. It has
not long been forgotten to what point the Emperor
waved Ins hand,' to signify where his pursuers
might find the treasure which might secure to him
hisliberty. At a league’s distance, to the e. of the
city, arc seen the termas, or baths, as they are
called, of the Inca ; the waters of which are not
so plentiful as they were formerly, although so hot
as to boil an egg ; but the egg, although it ap-
pears completely done, will, if put on a common
fire to boil, take just as much time as an egg which
is perfectly cold ; if kept a day or more it breaks,
and the smell and flavour of h, when eaten, is like
mud ; but if it be not eaten until it be cold, then
its flavour is similar to that of any other egg* On
the banks of the stream from whence these waters
flow, and in the pools formed by them, there is
found a multitude of animalcule, which looked at
through a microscope appear like shrimps. Lat.

==[[Caxamarquilla Y Cotj|CAXAMARQUILLA y Cotj]]==.aos, a pro-
vince and corregimiento of [[Peru]], called also Pa-
tiiz ; bounded e. by the mountains of the infidel
Indians, n.e. and n. by the province of [[Cha]]-
chapoyas, ti.zo. by that of Caxarnarca, the river
Marailon flowing between the two, w. by part of
the province of Conchucos, and s. by that of Iluai-
malies. It is 26 leagues long from ?^. to s. and six
wide, where it extends itself farthest along the e.
shore of the river Maranon, Avhich divides this
province from those of Conchucos and Huama-
chuco. Its temperature is various ; in the hol-
lows and uneven I'laces it is mild ; in the parts
lying upon the above river it is hot, and in the
very lofty parts it is cold. The territory is rugged
and uneven, and a level spot of ground, or Uarmra,
is scarcely to be seen throughout the w'hole. On
the e. side it is as it were walled in by vejy

lofty and craggy mountains, increasing in height
until they gradually reach the loftiest summit:
but these are the provident sources of streams
which flow down from them into the Maranon, and
which, together with the rains, fertilize several spots
of kind, producing maize, wheat, potatoes, ocas,
bark, French beans, herbs, and sugar-cane, for the
working of which there are mills on the spot.
Every kind of cattle is found here in moderation,
and the Maranon abounds in fish. Almost all the
mountains of this province have in them veins of
silver and gold ore : but these are very deceitful,
and as well upon this account as from the want of
hands, they are for the most part abandoned. The
gold mines, however, have always been worked,
though the silver mines not more than 20 years
back up to now, in which time some riches have
been discovered ; and even at the present day the
gold mines would produce 600 marks, and those of
silver 3000. The trade of the mines is certainly
the principal commerce of the place, and it is faci-
litated by four ports in the Maranon, which afford
a convenient opening and communication with the
other provinces. The inhabitants of this place
scarcely amount to 8000, who live in 17 settle-
ments. Its repartimiento used to amount to
50,000 dollars, and its alca'oala to 400 dollars
per annum.
