[==[[Crow’s Meadows|Crow’s Meadows]]==, a river in the n.w. ter-
ritory, which runs n. w. into Illinois river, oppo-

[==[[Crown Point Is The Most S|CROWN Point is the most s]]==. township in
Clinton county, New York, so called from the
celebrated fortress which is in it, and which was
garrisoned by the British troops, from the time of its
reduction by General Amherst, in 1759, till the late
revolution. Itwastakenby the Americans the I4th
of May 1775, and retaken by the British the year
after. The point upon which it was erected by
the French in 1731, extends n. into lake Champ-
lain. It was called Kruyn Punt, or Scalp Point,
by the Dutch, and by the French, Pointe-a-la-
Chevelure ; the fortress they named Fort St. Fre-
derick. After it was repaired by the British, it
was the most regular and expensive of any con-
structed by them in America ; the walls are of
wood and earth, about 16 feet high and about 20
feet thick, nearly 150 yards square, and surround-
ed by a deep and broad ditch dug out of the solid
rock ; the only gate opened on the n. tow'ards the
lake, where was a draw-bridge and a covert way,
to secure a communication with the waters of the
lake, in case of a siege. On the right and left, as
you enter the fort, is a row of stone barracks, not
elegantly built, which are capable of containing
2000 troops. There were formerly several out-
works, which are now in ruins, as is indeed the case
with the principal fort, except the walls of the
barracks. The famous fortification called Ticon-
deroga is 15 miles s. of this, but that fortress is
also so much demolished, that a stranger would
scarcely form an idea of its original construction.
The town of Crown Point has no rivers ; a few
streams, however, issue from the mountains, which
answer for mills and common uses. In the moun-
tains, which extend the whole length of lake
George, and part of the length of lake Champlain,
are plenty of moose, deer, and almost all the other
inhabitants of the forest. In 1790 the town con-
tained 203 inhabitants. By the state census of
1796, it appears there are 126 electors. The
fortress lies in lat. 43° 56' n. ; long. 73° 2P
w.~\
