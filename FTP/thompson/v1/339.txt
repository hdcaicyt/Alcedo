==[[Catamarca|CATAMARCA]]==, S, Fernando de, a city of
tbe province and government of [[Tucuman]], found-
ed by Juan Gomez Zurita, in 1538, in the fertile
and extensive valley of Conando. It has a fort to
repress the encroachments of the Indians. The
name of Canete was given it in honour to the vice-
roy who then commanded in [[Peru]] ; this was after-
wards changed to London, in honour to the queen
of England, wife of Philip II. king of Spain. The
inquietudes caused amongst the inhabitants by the
infidel Indians induced Don Geronimo Luis de
Cabrera, son of a governor of that province, in
1663, to remove it to another not less fertile val-
ley, and to give it the name of San J uan de la Ri-
vero ; and lastly, by the permission of the king,
in 1683, it was transferred to a spot in the valley
of Catamarca ; where it still remains, under the
same title, at 80 leagues distance from its first sta-
tion. It has, besides the parish church, a convent
of the Recoletos monks of St. Francis, with the
dedicatory title of San Pedro de Alcantara ; an
hospital of Merced ; aud a house of residence,
which formerly belonged to the regulars of the
company of Jesuits. On the w. side of the val-
ley is a mountain in which there are gold mines ;
and on the w. also from n. to s. runs a serrama^ the
skirts of which are for many leagues covered with
estates and cultivated grounds, and filled, from
the abundance of fine pastures, with lage and small
cattle and with mules. A tolerably large river
runs through the valley in the rainy season, and
terminates in some lakes M’hich are formed by it
about 30 leagues s. of the city. The commerce of
this city is very small, so that there is no coin cur-
rent ; and even the payments of the royal duties
are paid in effects, and in the productions of the
country, such as cotton, linens, pepper, brandy,
and wheat. Lat. 27° s.
