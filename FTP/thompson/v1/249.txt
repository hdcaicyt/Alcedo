•which is the greatest, finest, and safest in all the
S, sea. There is anchorage every av here in very
deep water, Avithout danger of rocks or shoals,
except one, which is three cables length from the
shore, about the middle of the island of [[St]]. Luav-
rence, opposite La Galatea. The little island of
Gallao lies just before the town. In the opening
between these tAvo islands, there are two small
islets, or rather rocks; there is also a third very
low, but half a league out at sea, s. s. e. from the

w. point of the island of [[St]]. LaAvrence. Near
the sea-side is the governor’s house, which, Avith
the viceroy’s palace, take up tAvo sides of a square;
the parish church makes a third; and a battery of
three pieces of cannon forms the fourth. The
churches are built of canes interAVOven, and cover-
ed' with clay, or painted white. Here are five
monasteries, and an hospital. The houses are in
general built of slight materials ; the singular cir-
cumstance of its never raining in this country
renders stone houses unnecessary ; and besides,
these are more apt to suffer from earthquakes,
Avhich are frequent here. The most remarkable
happened in the year 1746, Avhich laid |ths of
Lima level with the ground, and entirely demo-
lished Callao ; where the destruction Avas so en-
tire, that only one man, of SOOO inhabitants, Avas
left to record this dreadful calamity. Lat. 12° 2'
