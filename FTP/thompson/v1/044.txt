==[[America|AMERICA]]==.

cription of which wc Inve referred to the Chroni-
cles of Antonio de Herrera, as being the most
punctual and complete.

in what regards those who first peopled, and
who were the ancient inhabitants of this hemis-
phere, and from Avhencc they came, we leave this
problem to be answered by the numerous cele-
brated historians and philosophers who have writ-
ten so much upon this subject ; observing only,
that the opinion which, at the present day, most
generally obtains, is, that America was peopled in
the n. part, from Kamtchatka.

[==[[America is one of the four quarters of the
world]]==, probably the largest of the whole, and is,
from its late discovery, frequently denominated the
New World, or New Hemisphere. This vast
country extends from the 56th degree of lat. to
the north pole, and from the 55th to the 165th de-
gree of long, from Greenwich. It is nearly
10,000 miles in length. Its average breadth may
be about 1800 or 2000 miles. It has two sum-
mers and a double winter, and enjoys almost all the
variety of climates ivhich the earth affords. It is
washed by two great oceans. To the e. it has
the Atlantic, which divides it from Europe and
Africa. To the w. it has the Pacific, or Great
S. sea, by which it is separated from Asia. By
these it carries on a direct commerce with the other
three parts of the world. America is divided into two
great continents, called North and South America,
by an isthmus about 500 miles long, and which,
at Darien, about lat. 9° n. is only 60 miles over ;
other Avriters say 34 miles. This isthmus, with the
n. and s. continents, forms the Gulph of Mexico,
in and near which lie a great number of islands,
called the West Indies, in contradistinction to the
eastern parts of Asia, which are called the East
Indies.

==[[In America Nature Seems To Have Carried On Her
Operations Upon A Larger Scale|In America Nature seems to have carried on her
operations upon a larger scale]]==, and with a bolder
hand, and to have distinguished the features of
this country by a peculiar magnificence. The
mountains of America are much superior in height
to those in the other divisions of the globe. Even
the plain of Quito, which may be considered as
the base of the Andes, is elevated farther above the
level of the sea than the top of the Pyrenees in
Europe ; and Chimborazo, the most elevated point
of the Andes, is 20,280 feet high, which is at least
7102 feet above the Peak of Teneriffe. From the
lofty and extensive mountains of America, descend
rivers, with which the streams of Europe, of
Asia, or of Africa, are not to be compared, either
for length of course, or for the vast body of water

which they convey to the ocean. The Danube,
the Indus, the Ganges, or the Nile, in the e. hemi-
sphere, are not of equal magnitude, even with the
St. Lawrence, the Missouri, or the Mississippi, in
N. America ; and fall far short of the Amazon
and the La Plata in S. America.

==[[The Lakes Of The Noav World Arc No Less Con 
Spicuous For Grandeur Than Its Mountains And
Rivers|The lakes of the Noav World arc no less con-
spicuous for grandeur than its mountains and
rivers]]==. There is nothing in other parts of the
globe which resembles the prodigious chain of
lakes in N. America, viz. Superior, Michigan,
Huron, Erie, and Ontario : they may be properly
termed inland seas of fresh water ; and even those
of the second or third class are of greater circuit
(the Caspian sea excepted) than the greatest lake
of the ancient continent.

==[[The Luxuriance Of The Vegetable Creation In The
New World Is Extremely Great|The luxuriance of the vegetable creation in the
New World is extremely great]]==. In the s. pro-
vinces, where the moisture of the climate is aided
by the warmth of the sun, the woods are almost
impervious, and the surface of the ground is hid
from the eye under a thick covering of shrubs, of
herbs, and weeds. In the n. provinces, although
the forests are not incumbered with the same wild
luxuriance of vegetation, the trees of various spe-
cies are generally more lofty, and often much
larger, than are to be seen in any other parts of the
world.

==[[Notwithstanding the many settlements of the
Europeans on this continent]]==, great part of Ame-
rica remains still unknoAvn. The n. continent
contains the four British provinces, viz. 1. Up-
per Canada ; 2. Lower Canada, to which are
annexed New-Britain, and the island of [[Cape]]
Breton ; 3. Neiv-Brunswick ; 4. Nova Scotia, to
which is annexed St. John’s island. Besides these
there are the island of Newfoundland, and the 16
United States. It contains also the Spanish terri-
tories of E. and W. Florida, Louisiana, New
Mexico, California, and Mexico. Besides these
there are immense unexplored regions to the w. and
n. w. Thc5. continent has been already delineated.

==[[America]]==, so far as is known, is chiefly claimed
and divided into colonies by three European na-
tions, the Spaniards, British, and Portuguese. The
Spaniards, as they first discovered it, have the
largest and richest portion, extending from Louisi-
ana and New Mexico in N. America, to the straits
of Magellan in the S. sea, excepting the large
province of [[[[Brasil|Brazil]]]], which belongs to Portugal;
for though the French and Dutch have some forts
upon Surinam and Guayana, they scarcely deserve
to be considered as proprietors of any part of the
s. continent.
