1. Discovery. — The coast of [[[[Brasil|Brazil]]]], as has beenbe-
fore observed, was first discovered by Vincente Yanez
Pinzon. He had sailed with Columbus in 1498,
on his first voyage, as commander and ma^ster of
the Nina. Seven years afterwards he and his ne-
phew Arias obtained a commission to go in search
of new countries, and trade in any which Colum-
bus had not previously appropriated. The Pin-
zons were wealtiiy men, and the former voyage
had added to their wealth ; they fitted out four
caravels at their own cost, and set sail from Palos
in December 1499, made the capede Verds, then
steered to the s. w. and were the first Spaniards
who crossed the line and lost sight of the n. star.
After suffering intolerable heat, and storms which
drove them on their way, they saw land on Ja-
nuary 26, 1500, in lat. s. to which Vincente
gave the name of cape Consolation ; but which is
now called cape St. Augustines. They landed,
cut the names of the ships, and the date of the
year and day upon the trees and rocks, and took pos-
session of the country for the crown of Castille.

==[[The Coast Which Pinzon Had Discovered Lay
Within The Portuguese Limits Of Demarcation ; And
Before He Reached Europe|The coast which Pinzon had discovered lay
within the Portuguese limits of demarcation ; and
before he reached Europe]]==, in 1500, it had been
taken possession of by the nation to whom it was
allotted. As soon as Vasco da Gama had returned
from the discovery of India, King Emanuel fitted
out a second and far more powerful expedition, to
the command of which he appointed tiie Fidalgo
Pedro Alvarez Cabral.

2. Possession taken for the crown of Portugal . —
The Portuguese ships of discovery had hitherto
taken out stone pillars, with the arms of Portugal
engraved thereon, to set up in the lands which
they might find, and by this act secure them for
King Emanuel. Cabral, upon his landing at
Puerto Seguro, was not provided with these pil-
lars, because his destination was to follow the track
of Gama ; possession had been taken all the way
which he was to steer, and no discovery of new
countries was expected from him. He erected a
stone cross instead, and took possession of the
who’e province for the crown of Portugal, naming
it Santa Cruz, or the Land of the Holy Cross.

3. The country obtains the name of [[Brasil|Brazil]].— -
But the honour of haying formed the first settle-

ment in this country, is due to Amerigo Vespucci
in 1504. It does not appear that any farther atten-
tion was at this time paid to it. No gold had been
found, and it produced no articles of commerce
which could be thought worthy the notice of a go-
vernment whose coffers were overflowing with
the produce of the spice trade, and the riches of
the African mines. But the cargo of [[Brasil|Brazil]] which
Vespucci had brought home, tempted private ad-
venturers, who were content with peaceful gains,
to trade thither for that valuable wood ; and this
trade became so well known, that in consequence
the coast and the whole country obtained the name
of Brazil, notwithstanding the holier appellation
which Cabral had given it.

4. Criminals sent to serve there.— It was the sys-
tem of the Portuguese government to make its cri-
minals of some use to the state, and this system was
extended to [[Brasil|Brazil]] ; for the first Europeans who
were left ashore there were two convicts.

5. [[Brasil|Brazil]] divided into captaincies .—It was not
until thirty years after its discovery, that the coun-
try appears to have become of sufficient import-
ance to have obtained any consideration at court ;
and in order to forward its colonization, the same
plan was adopted which had succeeded well in
Madeira and in the Azores, that of dividing it info
hereditary captaincies, and granting them to such
persons as were willing to embark adequate means
in the adventure, with powers of jurisdiction, both
civil and criminal, so extensive as to be in fact un-
limited. This method was tiiought to be the ea-
siest and least expensive to government. The
difference between desert islands and a peopled
continent had not been considered. The captains
of the islands might easily settle lands in which
there could be no opposition, and easily at any
time assist each other with supplies : if their means
failed, they could even borrow from Portugal, those
places being so near that they were regarded almost
as things within the country. But when Joam
divided the coast of [[Brazil]] into great captaincies,
each extending along 50 leagues of coast, large
tribes of savages were in possession of the coun-
try, Portugal was far distant, and the settlements
so far asunder, that one could not possibly afford
assistance to another.

6. Martini Affonso de The first person

vrho took possession of one of these captaincies
was Martim Aft'onso de Sousa, whose name fre-
quently occurs in the history of Portuguese India,
where he was afterwards governor, and who is fa-
mous in Catholic history for having carried out
St. Francisco Zavier to the east. He and his
brother, Pero Lopes de Sousa, ha ving each obtained}
