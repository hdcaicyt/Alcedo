==[[Asuai|ASUAI]]==, Paramo de, a snowy mountain of the
cordillera of the kingdom of [[Quito]] ; one of those
which form the cordillera in the road, to Cuenca.
When it is covered Avith snow, its cold renders it
impervious, and this season is called “ de paramo,”
(desert), since then there is a constant fall of snow,
or small sleet, accompanied with a sharp wind.
Its skirts abound in marshes, which render the
road very dangerous to travellers, obliging them to
wait for the time when it may be passed with
safety, lest they should, as has happened to some
adventurers, perish in the attempt. In its vicinity
is an estate called La Capilla de Asuai.
