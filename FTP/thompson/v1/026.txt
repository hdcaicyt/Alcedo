gate these parts are accustomed to pass round be-
yond them for fear of venturing amongst them, al-
though there are some good cliannels among them,
and withgood soundings. They are for the most part
barren, producing nothing beyond a herb called
moron, -And deficient in fresh water ; neither do they
produce any animal except the mole, which is
found here in prodigious numbers. There are,
however, a quantity of birds, of three distinct sorts,
each forming a community of itself, and entirely
separated from the other two ; and it has been
observed, that if one party may have fixed upon
any place for building their nests, the others never
think of disturbing them, or driving them from it ;
but the noise these birds make is so great, that one
cannot pass near them without suffering consider-
ably from their united clamours.
