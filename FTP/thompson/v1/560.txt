[==[[Cumberland Mountain Occupies A Part Of
The Uninhabited Country Of The State Of Tennessee|Cumberland Mountain occupies a part of
the uninhabited country of the state of [[Tennessee]]]]==,
between the districts of Washington and Hamilton
and Mero district, and between the two first
named districts and the state of Kentucky. The
ridge is about SO miles broad, and extends from
Crow creek, on Tennessee river, from s. w. ion. e.
The place where the Tennessee breaks through the
Great ridge, called the Whirl or Suck, is 250
miles above the Muscle shoals. Limestone is
found on both sides the mountain. The moun-
tain consists of the most stupendous piles of craggy
rocks of any mountain in the w. country ; in
several parts of it, it is inaccessible for miles, even
to the Indians on foot. In one place particularly,
near the summit of the mountain, there is a most
remarkable ledge of rocks, of about SO miles in
length, and 200 feet thick, shewing a perpen-
dicular face to the s. e. more noble and grand than
any artificial fortification in the known world, and
apparently equal in point of regularity.]

[==[[Cumberland River|Cumberland River]]==, called by the Indians
“ Shawanee,” and by the French “ Shavanon,”
falls into the Ohio 10 miles above the mouth of
Tennessee river, and about 24 miles due e. from
fort Massac, and 1113 below Pittsburg. It is
navigable for large vessels to Nashville in Ten-
nessee, and from thence to the mouth of Obed’s or
Obas river. The Caney-fork, Harpeth, Stones,
Red, and Obed’s, are its chief branches ; some of
them are navigable to a great distance. The
Cumberland mountains in Virginia separate the
head waters of this river from those of Clinch
river ; it runs s. w. till it comes near the s. line of
Kentucky, when its course is w. in general,
through Lincoln county, receiving many streams
from each side ; thence it flows s. w. into the state
of Tennessee, where it takes a winding course, in-
closing Sumner, Davidson, and Tennessee coun-
ties ; afterwards it takes a n. w. direction, and re-
enters the state of [[Kentucky]] ; and from thence it
preserves nearly an uniform distance from Tennes-
see river to its mouth, where it is 300 yards wide.
It is 200 yards broad at Nashville, and its whole
length is computed to be above 450 miles.]

island, on the n. w. coast of N. America. The
port is capacious and safe. In this port Captain
Ingraham remained some time, and he observes,
in his journal, that here, in direct opposition to
most other parts of the world, the women main-
tained a precedency to the men in every point ;
insomuch that a man dares not trade without the
concurrence of his wife, and that he has often been
witness to men’s being abused for parting with
skins before their approbation was obtained ; and
this precedency often occasioned much disturbance.
