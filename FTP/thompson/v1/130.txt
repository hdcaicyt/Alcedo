waters called Balltown springs, from their being
found within the limits of this town, are of great
celebrity, both on account of their healing virtue
and the superior accommodation found near them
for valetudinarians. They are situated about 12
miles w. of Still water, 14 from that part of the
banks of the Hudson fam.ous for the victory of
General Gates over General Burgoyne, 36 n. of
Albany, SO s. of lake George, and 196 above the
city of New York. The springs are found in the
bottom of a valley, or excavation, forming a kind
of basin, of about 50 acres in extent. In this
hollow grow lofty pines, which are overtopped by
others, and rise at a greater or less distance above
the brim of this basin. The woods are pretty well
cleared near the springs. There is a large house
for entertainment, with neat bathing-houses and
shower-baths for the convenience of invalids.
These, as also the greatest part of the valley, be-
long to an eminent merchant of New York ; the
largest spring, however, belongs to the public.
Sir William Johnson made this observation when
he sold this tract of land to private individuals :

“ In tracing the history of these medicinal springs,

1 could only learn that an Indian chief discovered
them to a sick French officer in the early part of
their wars with the English : but whether they
were these very springs in this basin, or those at
ten miles distance, properly called the Saratoga
Springs, I know not.” The soil for half a dozen
miles round this place is poor and sandy, producing
little else than pine trees, shrub-oaks, fern, and
mullen. In the bills in ihe vicinity ores have been
accidentally found, especially iron and copper, or
rather what the mineralogists call ferruginous and
cupreous pyrites. The valley of Balltown and
its environs may be made an enchanting spot, equal,
nay superior, in some respects, to any of the water-
ing places in Europe. The Kayaderassofas river,
w hich is about 10 yards wide, gives several hints
to tlie man of taste, to turn its waters to the use
and beauty of the future town, which these medi-
cinal springs will one day raise in this place. The
medicinal waters which have made this spot so
famous of late are remarkably limpid. Considering
they contain iron, a mineral alkali, common salt,
and lime. They are brisk and sparkling like cham-
paigne. In drinking they aftect tlie nose and palate
like bottled beer, and slightly affccl tlie head of
some people by their inebriating quality. They
derive this exhilarating quality from what Dr.
Priestley calls^.redmV, and is that animating some-
ihinst which gives activity to yeast, and life to
malt liquors. It is used, in the neighbourhood of
the springs, instead of yeust in making bread; and

makes it rise more speedily and effectually than
any other ferment in ordinary use. Horses drink
these waters with avidity. The ignorant country
people see, with astonishment, that a candle will
not burn near the surface of these waters. Fish
and frogs are killed in a few minutes, and geese
and ducks can only swim in them a few minutes
before they expire. These waters are apt to burst
bottles when corked in very warm weather, espe-
cially during a thunder storm ; but with care may
be transported in bottles to any distance. They
boil with a very moderate degree of heat ; they
are nevertheless remarkably cold ; for when the
mercury in Fahrenheit’s thermometer stood at 86° in
the open air, and 79° in the brook running near
the spring, it stood in one of these mineral springs
at 49°, and in the other at 51° : the first was con-
stantly excluded from the rays of the sun, the la.st
always exposed without a covering. Physicians
seldom direct their patients to drink more than
three quarts of these waters in twelve hours ; but
some drink the enormous quantity of three gallons^
and even more, in a day. Cold as they are, they
may be drank with safety in the hottest weather.
They increase every natural evacuation, nay, they
are cathartic, diuretic, and sudorific, at the same
time, On the first trial they are apt to disagree
with many people ; they create uneasiness in the
stomach and bowels, and cause a heat in the glands
of the throat, until they begin to pass off freely by
the kidneys ; they then become pleasant, and
operate agreeably. They blacken the teeth and
also the alvine faeces : they are deemed a specific
in loss of appetite and indigestion ; they are highly
serviceable in hypochondriac eases, in obstructions,
and in the stone and gravel, and cutaneous dis-
orders : their credit is not so well established in
the gout or rheumatism : they are hurtful in in-
flammatory disorders and consumptions : their use
occasions heat in the glands of the throat, and stiff-
ness of the neck ; and in such as are subject to tho
tooth-ache, an aggravation of the pain : they are
a poAverful and precious remedy in the hands of the
judicious, but ought never to be used without the
advice of a skilful physician.]
