state to maintain itself. Thus the colonists lived

[==[[Albion|ALBION]]==, New, the name given by Sir
Francis Drake to California, and part of the n. w.
coast of [[America]], when he took possession of it.
A large uncertain tract of the n. w, coast is thus
called. Its limits, according to Mr. Arrow-
smith’s chart, are between 27° 12' and 41° 15'
71. lat. Humboldt asserts, that, agreeably to sure
historical data, the denomination of New Albion
ought to be limited to that part of the coast which
extends from the 43° to the 48°, or from Cape
White of Martin de x\guilar, to the entrance of
Juan de Fuea. Besides, he adds, from the mis-
sions of the Catholic priests to those of the Greek
priests, that is to say, from the Spanish village of
San Francisco, in New California, to the Russian
establishments on Cook river at Prince William’s
bay', and to the islands of Kodiac and Unalaska,
there are more than a thousand leagues of coast
inhabited by' free men, and stocked with otters and
Phocre! Consequently, the discussions on the
extent of the New Albion of Drake, and the pre-
tended rights acquired by certain European na-
tions, from planting small crosses, and leaving
inscriptions fastened to trunks of trees, or the
burying of bottles, may be considered as futile.
The part of the coast on which Capt. Cook landed
on the 7th of March 1778, and which some desig-
nate as Nezo Albion, is in n. lat. 44° 33'. e. long.
235° 10', which he thus describes : “ The land
is lull of mountains, the tops of w hich are covered
with snow, while the vallies between them, and
the grounds on the sea-coast, high as well as low,
are covered with trees, which form a beautiful
prospect, as of one vast forest. At first the natives
seemed to prefer iron to every other article of

commerce; at last they preferred brass. They
were more tenacious of their property than any of
the savage nations that had hitherto been met
with ; so that they would not part with wood,
water, grass, nor the most trifling article without
a compensation, and were sometimes very unrea-
sonable in their demands.” See Calii^ornia,
New.]
