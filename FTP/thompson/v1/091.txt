cusfomed to carry on a trade with the Spaniards,
exchanging their manufactures of wool, and their
horses, not inferior to those of the famous Andalu-
cian breed, for wine, leatlier, and earthen ware.
They have no cliief or head to govern them : all
military authority rests in their elders, to Avhom
they pay the same respect as though they were the
fathers of the country, and from them, in times of
war, they select a general or commander, whom
they call toquil^ and he is the arbiter both of
war and of peace. His armies are formed from
the various tribes, and meet together with the ut-
most quietness ; they are composed of cavalry and
infantry ; their first attack is terrible, especially that
of the foremost ranks ; they have some few fire
arms and swords, but the principal and most com-
mon weapon is a long and thick lance, which they
manage with great dexterity. They are robust,
handsome, and liberal, but much addicted to ine-
briety and sensuality ; nevertheless the men, as
W'ell as the women, live honestly after their fashion.
The Spaniards, to defend themselves against their
invasions, have built some forts upon the confines,
furnished w'ith men and artillery ; and in its dis-
trict is celebrated, once a year, a kind of fair, at
which a meeting is made between the president of
Chile and the ancients of these Indians, to ratify
the treaties of peace ; and the former makes, in
the name of the king, various presents of leather,
wine, and cloths of different colours. The num-
ber of inhabitants is very considerable, as well
through the polygamy that prevails here, as that
the climate contributes to propagation. In its dis-
trict are mines of gold of excellent quality, but
they are not worked. [^In the s. provinces of the
Araucanos, between the river Biobio and the Archi-
pelago of Chiloe, several very rich mines of gold
were formerly discovered, which yielded immense
sums ; but since the expulsion of the Spaniards
from those provinces by the Araucanos, these
mines hare been in the possession of that warlike
people, who have prohibited the opening them
anew by any one under pain of death. In the
territory of these Indians is the Quila rush, of
which they make excellent lances ; also a shrub
producing honey, and the boighe tree, which they
have, from time immemorial, considered sacred,
carrying its branches in their hands on the conclu-
sion of a peace, as the ancient nations of Europe
did those of the olive. See a complete history of
their manners, 4'c. in article Chile.]

==[[Arauco|ARAUCO]]==, a settlement of the province and go-
vernment of Tucuman, in the district of the city of
Rioja. It is fertile in wine of excellent quality,

but in everything besides very poor; for which
reason they petitioned the king, as arbitrator in
their caiise, to provide for this unproductiveness of
soil by encouraging their mines, and, for this pur-
pose, allowing tlieru to avail themselves of the mule
trade carried on between the jurisdiction of Cor-
dova and [[Peru]].

==[[Arauco]]==, a fort in the kingdom of [[Chile]], on
the shores of the river Tucapel, built for the pur-
pose of restraining the invasions of the infidel In-
dians. Close to it there was a college belonging
to the regulars of the abolished order of .Jesuits.

==[[Arau|ARAU]]==.JA, a settlement of the island of [[Trini]]-
dad, in the kingdom of [[Tierra Firme]], situate on
the e. coast behind the point of Los Arracifes.

==[[Araujo|ARAUJO]]==, a settlement of the province and go-
vernment of Santa Marta in the kingdom of [[Tierra]]
Firme, situate at the mouth of the river Magda-
lena.

==[[Arauna Puru|ARAUNA-PURU]]==, a river of the country of
Las Amazonas, in the territory of the Portuguese.
It runs n. n. w. and enters the Curaaypi.

==[[Araure|ARAURE]]==, a city of the province and govern-
ment of Yenezuela in the kingdom of [[Tierra]]
Firme. It is on the shore of the river Acarigua,
and n. n. e. of the city of Truxillo. [The city of
Araure is one of theâ€™flappy results of the labours of
the first Capuchin missionaries of Andalucia, who,
by persuasion and mildness, effected that which
was thought impossible to be accomplished but by
force of arms ; namely, the bringing to a civilized
life its savage and idolatrous race of Indians. The
situation of Araure is fine, agreeable, and advan-
tageous. Three rivers water its territory, which is
fertile, but of which the inhabitants are far from
making every advantage. Their principal and
almost sole occupation is (he rearing of cattle.
They cultivate only some cotton and a little coffee.
The ground of the city is regular and agreeable.
The streets are straight. It has a handsome square.
The houses are well built ; but the only thing
worthy of note is the church, which is superb,
and famed for the image of our Lady of Corteza,
who enjoyes the public veneration, not only of all
the faithful of the city, but also of all those in the
surrounding villages, although the fame of her
power and miracles arc not equal to those ascribed
to our Lady of Comoroto.]

==[[Arauro|ARAURO]]==, a celebrated gold mine in the pro-
vince and corregimiento of [[Condesuyos]] of Arc-
quipa in [[Peru]]. It is of metal of the best quality,
but little worked, both on account of the hardness
of the stone and of its depth, w hich makes the la-
bour of it very expensive.
