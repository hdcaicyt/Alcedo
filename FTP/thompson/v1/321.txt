emolument which used to be derived to the Eng-
lish froPA the skins of the castor, is at present
greatly abridged from the circumstance of the In-
dians invariably destroying this animal; but the
loss is in a great measure made up from the great
gain acquired in the sale of turpentine, fish, and
pitch. Here they cultivate quantities of indigo
of three sorts, much maize, and in the low lands
excellent rice. All this province is a plain 80
miles in length, carrying on a great commerce in
the above productions, and formerly that of rice
was very considerable; it being computed to have
yielded that article to the value of 150,000/. ster-
ling per annum. In its woods are many exquisite
kinds of timber, and the country abounds with
rabbits, hares, dantas, deer, pheasants, partridges,
cranes, pigeons, and other birds, and with num-
bers of ravenous and fierce wolves, against the
attacks of which it is difficult to preserve the
cattle. The European animals have also multi-
plied here astonishingly, so that it is not unusual
for persons, who at first had not more than three or
four cows, now to possess as many thousands.
These two provinces forming Carolina have 10
navigable rivers, with an infinite number of smaller
note, all abounding in fish ; but they hare few
good ports, and the best of these is Cape Fear.
N. Carolina is not so rich as is S. Carolina, and
Denton was formerly the capital of the former,
but it is at present reduced to a miserable village ;
the capital of both is Charlestown, which since the
last w^r is independent of the jEnglish, together
with all the country, which now forms one of the 13
provinces composing the United States of America.

[==[[Caroline County|CAROLINE County]]==, inTirginia, is on the s.
side of Rappahannock river, which separates it
from King George’s county. It is about 40 miles
square, and contains 17,489 inhabitants, including
10,292 slaves.]

Catalanian Capuchin fathers.

and of a hot temperature, but abounding in fruits
of maize, lyucas, plaintains, and sugar-canes.

whole province. It abounds in gold mines, and
is fertile in all the fruits peculiar to the climate,
but it is much reduced.

==[[Caroni]]==, a large and abundant river of the pro-
vince of Guayana. It rises in the mountains in-
habited by the Mediterranean Caribes Indians,
runs many leagues, laving the territory of the Ca-
puchin missionaries of Guayana. Its shores are
very delightful, from the variety of trees and birds
found upon them. It enters the Orinoco on the s.
side, eight leagues from the garrison of Guayana,
and 72 leagues before this river enters the sea, be-
ing divided into two arms, which form a small
island. It is very abundant and wide, but it is
not navigable, on account of the rapidity of its cur-
rent, and from its being filled with little islands and
shoals, as likewise on account of a great waterfall
or cataract, which causes a prodigious noise, and is
close to the mission and settlement of Aguacagua.
Its waters are very clear, although at first sight
they appear dark and muddy, which effect is pro-
duced from the bed of the river being of a sand of
this colour. Its source, though not accurately
known, is affirmed by the Caribes Indians to be
in the snowy sierra to the n. of the lake of Parime,
that also being the source by which this lake is
supplied. At its entrance into the Orinoco, it
gushes with &uch impetuosity as to repel the waters
of this river the distance of a gun’s shot, [or, as
'Depons observes, half a league. Its course is di-
rectly from s. to n. and its source is more than
100 leagues from its mouth.]

==[[Caropi|CAROPI]]==, a river of the island and government
of Trinidad. It runs from e. to w. and enters the
sea in the gulf Triste.

==[[Carora|CARORA]]==, S. Juan Bautista del Por-
tillo DE, a city of the province and government
of Venezuela, founded by Captain John Salamanca
in 1572, and not in 1566, as is asserted by Father
Coleti, in the Siege of Baraquiga. It is situate in
the savanas or Uanuras ; is of a hot temperature,
but very healthy, although deficient in water,
since the river Morere, which passes in its vicinity,
affords but a trifling stream in tlie summer, and is
at times entirely dry. In its district are bred all
kinds of cattle, but particularly thegoat, as the quan-
tities of thorns and thistles found in this country
render it peculiarly adapted for the nourishment
of this animal. It abounds in very fine grains,
also in aromatic balsams and gums, noted for the
cure of w'ounds. At present it is reduced to a
miserable population, unworthy of the name of a
city, consisting of Mustees, Mulattoes, and some In-
dians.; but it still preserves a very good parish
church, a convent of monks of St. hhancisco, and
