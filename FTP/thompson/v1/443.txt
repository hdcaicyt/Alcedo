mines have as yet been discovered here. These
islands have some ports, but such as are small, in-
secure, and without any defence, with the excep-
tion of that of Chacao. The inhabitants should
amount to 22,000 souls, and these are divided
into 4 1 settlements or parishes, being formed by
the reducciones of the missionaries of St. Francis,
and consisting at the present day, for the most
part, of Spaniards and Creoles. The capital is the
city of Santiago de Castro, in the large island of
Chiloe. [For further account, see index to addi-
tional history of Chile, chap. lY. § 35.]

==[[Chilon|CHILON]]==, a settlement of the province and go-
vernment of Santa Cruz de la Sierra in [[Peru]] ;
situate in a valley which is beautiful and fertile,
and which abounds in wheat. Twenty-eight leagues
from the settlement of Samaypata.

==[[Chilostuta|CHILOSTUTA]]==, a settlement of the province
and alcaldia mayor of [[Zedales]] in the kingdom of
Guatemala.

==[[Chilpansingo|CHILPANSINGO]]==, or Chilpantzinco, a set-
tlement of the intendancy of Mexico, surrounded
with fertile fields of wheat. Elevation 1080 me-
tres, or 3542 feet.

==[[Chilques Y Masques|CHILQUES Y Masques]]==, a province and
corregimiento of [[Peru]], bounded by the province
of Quispicanchi; s.e. by that of Churabivilcas ;
s. and s. w. by that of Cotabambas ; w. by that of
Abancay; and n. t®. by Cuzco. Its temperature
is various, the proportion of heat and cold being
regulated by its different degrees of elevation ; so
that in the quebradas or deep glens, it is warm,
and in the sierras or mountains, cold. It is 13
leagues in length, and 25 in width ; is watered by
three rivers, which are the Cusibamba, passing
through the valley of this name, the Velille, and
the Santo Tomas ; over these rivers are extended
seven bridges, which form a communication with
the other provinces. It has likewise eight small
lakes, and in some of these are found water-fowl.
The hot parts abound in all kinds of fruits ; in
wheat, maize, pulse, potatoes, and are well stocked
with some sorts of cattle, and great herds of deer.
Its natives fabricate the manufactures of the coun-
try ; such as cloths, baizes, and coarse frieze, by
means of chorillos, or running streams, as they
have no mills for fulling, since a royal licence is
necessary for the making use of the same. Al-
though the appearance of mines has in many
places been discovered amongst the mountains,
yet no mines have as yet been worked, and two
only have been known to have been opened in
former times. This province has suffered much
from earthquakes ; and the greatest of these hap-
pened in 1707, when many settlements were made

desolate. It is composed of 27 settlements, and
these contain 16,000 inhabitants. The capital is
Paruro ; and the repariimiento of the corregimiento
used to amount to 84,550 dollars, and the alcamla

==[[C Ill Ltepec|CIllLTEPEC]]==, a settlement of the head settle-
ment of Tepalcatcpcc in [[Nueva España]]. Its tem-
perature is the mildest of any part of its jurisdic-
tion. It is situate in the middle of a plain, ex-
tending over the top of a hill, on two sides of
which are large chasms, so immensely deep, that
it is really astonishing to observe how the Indians
contrive to cultivate the impoleras on their edges.
It contains 67 families of Indians, and is five leagues
to thes. of its head settlement.

==[[Cui Ltep Ec|CuiLTEPEc]]==, a river of the province and alcal-
diamayor of [[Tabasco]], which runs into the sea.

==[[Chima|CHIMA]]==, a mountain of the kingdom of [[Quito]],
in the government and corregimiento of [[Chirnbo]]
or Guaranda, to tire zo. of the settlement of Asan-
coto. It is entirely covered with woods and with
streams, which flow down from the heights into
the plains of Babahoyo. The river named De la
Chima runs from e. tow. until it joins the Caracol.
A way has been opened through this mountain
which leads to Guaranda or Guayaquil ; but it is
passable in the summer only. There is also an-
other pass equally difficult and dangerous, called
Angas. The cold is great at the top of the moun-
tain, and at the skirts the heat is excessive, it i.s
in lat. 44' s.
