[though the whole shore of New California was
carefully examined by the great navigator Sebas-
tian Viscaino, (as is proved by plans drawn up by
himself in 1602), this fine country was only, how-
ever, occupied by the Spaniards 167 years after-
Avards. The court of Madrid dreading lest the
other maritime powers of Europe should form
settlements on the n. w. coast of [[America]], which
mighi become dangerous to the Spanish colonics,
gave or(iers to the (Chevalier de Cri&gt;ix,the viceroy,
and tlie Visitador Galvez, to found missions and
presidios in the ports of San Diego and Monterey.
For this purpose two packet-boats set out from the
port ot San Bias, and anchored at San Diego in
the month of April 1763.

==[[Tlie]]==.'oil of New California is as well watered
and fertile as that of Old California is arid and
stony. It is one of the most picturesque countries
which can be seen. The climate is much more
mild there than in the same latitude on the e.
coa,st of (he new continent. The sky is foggy,
but the frequent fogs, which render it difficult to
land on the coast of [[Monterey]] and San Francisco,
give vigour to vegetation and fertilize the soil,
which is covered with a black and spongy earth.
In the 18 missions which now exist in New Cali-
fornia, wheat, maize, and haricots (frisoles ),
are cultivated in abundance. Barley, beans, len-
tiles, and garhanzos, grow very well in the fields
in the greatest part of the province. Good wine
is made in the villages of San Diego, San Juan
Capistrano, San Gabriel, Sm Buenaventura,
Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Santa Clara,
and San Jose, and all along the coast, s. and n.
of Monterey, to beyond the 37° of latitude. The
European olive is succtssfuily cultivated near the
canal of Santa Barbara, especially near San Diego,
where an oil is made as good as that of the valley
of Mexico, or the oils of Andaiucia.

==[[The Population Of New California|The population of New California]]==, including
only the Indians attached to the soil who have
begun to cultivate their fields, was

and in 1802, - - 15, "'62

==[[Thus the number of inhabitants has doubled in
12 years]]==. Since the foundation of these missions,
or between 1769 and 1802, there were in all, .ac-
cording to the parish registers, 33,7)7 baptisms,
8009 marriages, and 16,984 deaths. We must
not attempt to deduce from these data the ]iro-
portion between the births and deaths, because in
the number of baptisms the adult Indians (hs
neqfitos) are confounded with the children. The
estimation of the produce of the soil, or the har-

vests, furnishes also the most convincing proofs of
the increase of industry and prosperity of New
California. In 1791, according to the tables pub-
lished by M. Galiaiio, the Indians sowed in the
whole province only 874 bushels of whe.at, which
yieldecl a harvest of i5,197 bushels. The culti-
vation doubled in 1802; for the quantity of wheat
sown was 2089 bushels, and tlie harvest 33,576
bushels.

cattle (ganado mayor) in the whole of the Indian
villages. 'I'lic n. part of California is inhabited by
the two nations of the Rumsen and Escelen. They
speak languages totally different Irom one another,
and they torm the population of the presidio and
the village of Monterey. In the bay of San Fran-
cisco the l.iuguages of the different tribes of the
M.atalans, Salsen, and Quirotes, are derived from
a common root. Father Lasuen observed, that ou
an extent of 180 leagues of the coast of [[California]],
from San Diego to San Francisco, no fewer than
17 languages are spoken, which can hardly be
considered as dialects of a small number of mo-
ther languages. The population of New Cali-
fornia would have augmented still more rapidly
if the laws by which the Spanish presidios have
been governed for ages were not directly opposite
to the true interests of both mother-country and
colonies. By the.'e laws the soldiers stationed at
Monterey are not permitted to live out of their
barracks and to settle as colonists. The Indians
who inhabit the villages of New California have
been for some years employed in spinning coarse
woollen stuffs, called frisadas ; but their princi-
pal occupation, of which the produce might be-
come a very considerable branch of commerce, is
the dressing of stag-skins. In the cordillera of
small elevation which runs along the coast, as well
as in (he neighbouring savannas, there are neither
buffalos nor elks ; and on the crest of the moun-
tains which are covered with snow in the month
of November, the berrendos, with small chamois
horns, feed by tliemselves. But all the forest and
all the plains covered with gramina, are filled with
flocks of stags of a most gigantic size, the horns
of which are round and extremely large. Forty
or fifty of them are frequently seen at a time : (hey
are of a brown colour, smooth, and without spot.
Their horns, which are not palmated, are nearly
15 decimetres (4| feet) in length. Iti is affirmed
by every traveller, that this great stag of New Ca-“j
