archbishop in 1677 : he took possession of his ap-
pointment through his procurator onlj, for he died
before he reached it.

2. Don Fr. J uan De la Madre de Dios, of the order
of St. Francis; a provincial in that order, preacher
to the king, and examiner of the military orders ;
noted as being one of the most pleasing and elo-
quent orators of his time: he took possession of
the archbishopric in 1683, and governed only three
years, since he died in a plague which then pre-
vailed, in 1686.

3. Don Fr. Manuel de la Resurreccion, colle-
gian of San Pedro, doctor in canons and laws,
canon of the holy church of Lamego, and de-
puty of the holy office of the inquisition : disen-
gaging himself from the world, he quitted these
dignities, and entered the convent of Varatojo,
where the fame of his virtues caused him to be
elected archbishop of La Bahia. He entered his
office in 1688, and died in 1691.

4. Don Juan Franco de Oliveira, promoted to
the archbishopric of Angola : be was horned with
this metropolitan mitre for eight years, from

5. Don Sebastian Monteiro de Vide, who had
belonged to the company of Jesuits, but who, be-

in the university of Coimbra, and again embraced
an ecclesiastical state. In this he held different
commissions, and he was at last prior of Santa
Marina, and vicar-general of the archbishopric
of Lisbon, from whence he was elected to be the
archbishop of La Bahia in 1702, where he go-
verned with great address for the space of 20
years, notwithstanding the afflicting and severe
disorder which confined him nearly the whole of
this time to his chamber, and of which he died in
1722.

inent in [[Brasil|Brazil]], in 1549 ; and this he effected with
great skill, until, in 1553, he was recalled to Lis-
bon, and promoted to the office of master of the
horse to the royal family.

2. Don Duarte de Costa, chief armourer of the
king : he entered his office in 1553, and governed
until 1558, when he was succeeded by,

3. Mendo de Sa, an illustrious branch of the
house of the Marquises of Abrantes : he was elected
on account of his singular attainments, learning,
and military prowess ; though even these were ex-
ceeded by the happy establishments, the founda-
tions of settlements, and the brilliance of con-
quests to which he was accessary in [[Brasil|Brazil]] during
the 14 years of his reign ; he died in 1572, at
Bahia, universally regretted.

4. Don Luis de Vasconcelos: he died at sea,

owing to the misfortunes and long voyage of the
ill-omened fleet in which he had embarked.

vanced age, governed for three years only, and
died in 1681. A vacancy for two years then en-
sued, and the government was administered by the
council of Camara, and the eldest of the oidores,
Don Cosme Rangel de Macedo, until the right
governor came, who was,

7. Manuel Tellez Barreto, nominated by Philip
II. king of Spain, who, in 1583, inherited the
crown of Portugal. Although he was also much
advanced in years, the government suffered no-
thing on this account during the four years of his
power ; he died in 1587. In the vacancy, the
government was held by the bishop, Don Antonio
Barreiros, and the purveyor-general of the royal re-
venues, Christobal de Banos, who exercised it for
four years, until the year 1591.

8. Francisco Giraldes, senor proprietor of the cap-
tainship ofLosIlheos, which titlehad been purchas-

nominated governor, and having embarked at Lis-
bon, was driven back twice by distress, when,
auguring badly from this misfortune, he gave up
his appointment, and in his stead was nominated,

9. Don Francisco de Sousa, who entered La Bahia
in 1594 : he was first marquis of the mines, by
favour of the king, who promised him this title,
should he recover those mines which, according
to some, had been already discovered by Roberio
Diaz ; he was renowned for his skill and his good
