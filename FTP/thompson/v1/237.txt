==[[They settled on the river nearly opposite where
they now live]]==, on a low place, but were driven
thence on account of its overflowing, occasioned
by a mass of timber choking the river at a point
below them. The whole number of what they
call warriors of the ancient Caddo nation is now
reduced to about 100, who are looked upon some-
what like knights of Malta, or some distinguished
military order. They are brave, despise danger
or death, and boast that they have never shed
white man’s blood. Besides these, there are of old
men and strangers who live among’ them, nearly
the same number, but there are 40 or 50 more
women than men. This nation has great influence
over the Yattassees, Nandakoes, Nabadaches,
Inies or Yachies, Nagogdoches, Keychies, Adaize,
and Natchitoches, who all speak the Caddo lan-
guage, look up to them as their fathers, visit and
intermarry among them, and join them in all their
wars. The Caddoques complain of the Choctaws
encroaching upon their country ; call them lazy,
thievish, &c. There has been a misunderstanding
between them for several years, and small hunting
parties kill one another when they meet. 'J'he
Caddos raise corn, beans, pumpkins, &c. but the
land on which they now live is prairie, of a white
clay soil, very flat : their crops are subject to in-
jury, either by too wet or too dry a season. Tliey
have horses, but few of any other domestic
animals, except dogs ; most of them have guns,
and some have rifles : they, and all other Indiatis
that we have any knowledge of, are at war with
the Osages. The country, generally, round the
Caddos is hilly ami not very rich ; it is well cover-
ed with oak, hickory, and pine, interspersed with
prairies, which are, for the most part, very rich,
and fit for cultivation. There are here a good
number of creeks and springs of fresh water ]
