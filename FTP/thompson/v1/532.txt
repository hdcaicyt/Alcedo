datorj parties against the settlements in their vici-
nity. The Creeks are very badly armed, having
few rifles, and are mostly armed with muskets.
For near 40 years past, the Creek Indians have
had little intercourse with any other foreigners but
those of the English nation. Their prejudice in
favour of every thing English, has been carefully
kept alive by tories and others to this day. Most
of their towns have now in their possession British
drums, with the arms of the nation and other em-
blems painted on them, and some of their squaws
preserve the remnants of British flags. They still
believe that “ the great king over the water” is
able to keep the whole world in subjection. The
land of the country is a common stock ; and any
individual may remove from one part of it to an-
other, and occupy vacant ground where he can
find it. The country is naturally divided into
three districts, viz. the Upper Creeks, Lower and
Middle Creeks, and Seminoles. The upper dis-
trict includes all the waters of the Tallapoosee,
Coosahatchee, and Alabama rivers, and is called
the Abbacoes. The lower or middle district in-
cludes all the waters of the Chattahoosee and Flint
rivers, down to their junction ; and although oc-
cupied by a great number of different tribes, the
whole are called Cowetaulgas or Coweta people,
from the Cowetan town and tribe, the most warlike
and ancient of any in the whole nation. The
lower or s. district takes in the river Appala-
chicola, and extends to the point of E. Florida,
and is called the Country of the Seminoles. Agri-
culture is as far advanced with the Indians as it
can well be, without the proper implements of hus-
bandry. A very large majority of the nation
being devoted to hunting in the winter, and to war
or idleness in summer, cultivate but small parcels
of ground, barely sufficient for subsistence. But
many individuals, (particularly on Flint river,
among the Chehaws, who possess numbers of Ne-
groes) have fenced fields, tolerably well cultivated.
Having no ploughs, they break up the ground
with hoes, and scatter the seed promiscuously over
the ground in hills, but not in rows. They
raise horses, cattle, fowls, and hogs. The only
articles they manufacture are eartlien pots and
pans, baskets, horse-ropes or halters, smoked
leather, black marble pipes, wooden spoons, and
oil from acorns, hickery nuts, and chesnuts.]
