==[[Antequera|ANTEQUERA]]==, [now called Oaxaca,] a ca-
pital city of the province and alcaldia mayor of
Oaxaca in [[Nueva España]], founded in a beauti-
ful and spacious valley of this name, in 1528, by
Juan Nunez del Mercado. It is a large and fine
settlement, of an extensive vicinity and great com-
merce, as well from the fertility of its soil, and
from the abundance of its fruits, as from its being
in the direct road to the provinces of Guatemala.
It has, besides the curacy of the Sagrario of its
cathedral, the assisting parish chapels of La San-
gre de Christo, Nuestra Seiiora de las Nieves,
Nuestra Senora de la Consolacion, San Joseph,
the hospital of San Cosme and San Damian, and an
hermitage of La Santisima Trinidad ; eight con-
vents of monks, which are, two of Santo Domingo,
one called Elgrande, a sumptuous fabric, and the
other San Pablo ; one of Dezcalzos of San Fran-
cisco, that of San Augustin of Nuestra Senora de
la Merced, of Carmelitas Dezcalzos ; a college
which belonged to the abolished society of the re-
gular order of the Jesuits, with a house for stu-
dents ; two hospitals, one of San Juan de Dios,
and another of Bethlemites ; two colleges, deno-
minated Santa Cruz and San Bartolome, for the
education of children ; thirteen monasteries of
nuns, amongst which, are that of Santa Monica de
Augustinas, the church, which is of magnificent
structure, and the gate of most exquisite archi-
tecture, dedicated to Nuestra Senora de la Soled ad
(to whose image, it being very beautiful and mi-
raculous, that city pays singular devotion);
another of La Concepcion, another of Santa Cata-
lina de Sena, another of Capuchinas ; and a col-
lege for the education of children. The city is
one of those most conspicuous for the beautiful
symmetry of its streets, for its public places and
edifices, which would have been still finer, had
they not suffered by earthquakes. The tempera-

ture, although somewhat hot, is nevertheless
healthy. Its eastern part is situated upon the
long-continued top of a hill. It abounds in ex-
quisite fruits, such as pears of various kinds,
apples, sapaias, pomegranates, melons, pines,
dates, limes, cedars, lemons, pitahayas, nuts,
and some grapes. . Its wheat is scanty, and of bad
quality. The principal productions in which it
pays its duties to the King, are cacao of Soco-
nusco, ready-made chocolate, and powders of
Oaxaca, justly esteemed and celebrated for giving
a delicate ffavour to chocolate. It also fabricates
black sealing-wax and some rosaries, the beads of
which are made of the kernel of a fruit called &lt;c-
pexihte, on which they write with wonderful
skill some versicles of the magnificat, and paint
upon them images with a nicety that makes them
much esteeraeel. In the cathedral, which is beau-
tiful and amply large, (having three naves), as
well as in the chapels, is reverenced an arm of
San Juan Chrisostomo, with other precious relics ;
and in one of its chapels, a cross about a yard in
length, made from a part of that wonderful cross
of Guatulco, brought thither by the bishop Don
Juan de Cerbantes. The inhabitants of this illus-
trious city, which has San Marcial for its patron,
are composed of 6000 families ; and in the year
1766, through the benign influence of the pa-
tron, the number of souls amounted to 20 , 000 ,
It is 85 leagues to the e.s.e. of Mexico. Long,

[==[[Anterim|ANTERIM]]==, a township in Hillsborough coun-
ty, New Hampshire, having 528 inhabitants,
incorporated in 1777, 73 miles w. of Portsmouth ,
and about the same distance n. w. of Boston.]

[==[[Anthony’s Falls|ANTHONY’S Falls]]==, St. in the river Mis-
sissippi, lie about 10 miles n. w. of the mouth
of St. Pierre river, which joins the Mississippi
from the w. and are situated in about lat. 44° 50'
n. and were so named by father Louis Hennipin,
who travelled into those parts about the year 1680,
and was the first European ever seen by the na-
tives there. The whole river, 230 yards wide,
falls perpendicularly above 30 feet, and forms a
most pleasing cataract. The rapids below, in the
space of 300 yards, render the descent consider-
ably greater ; so that when viewed at a distance,
they appear to be much higher than they really
are. In the middle of the falls is a small island,
about 40 feet broad, and somewhat longer, on
which grow a few hemlock and spruce trees ; and
about half-way between this island and the eastern
shore, is a rock, lying at the very edge of (he fall,
in an oblique position, five or six feet broad, and
SO or 40 long. These fails are peculiarly situated,
