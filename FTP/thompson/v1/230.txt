the markets at New York to be forwarded to the
islands. It carries on a great commerce in hides,

[==[[Burlington is a pleasant township]]==, the chief
in Chittendon county, Vermont, situated on the

s. side of Onion river, on the &lt;?. bank of lake
Champlain. It has 332 inhabitants. It is in this
healthy and agreeable situation that the governor
and patrons of the college of Vermont intend to
found a seminary of learning, where youth of all
denominations may receive an education. In
digging a well, about 15 rods from the bank of the
river, frogs have been found, at the depth of 25
feet, where no cavities or communication with the
water appeared, through which they might have
passed ; and when exposed to the heat of the sun,
they became full of life and activity. Here stumps
of trees are found 40 feet deep. It ‘is conjectured
that these animals must have been covered up some
hundred years ago, by some inundation of the river.
