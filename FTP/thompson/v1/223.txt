in exchange for wine and brandies, and 150,000
ponchos, &c. Paraguay also furnishes Buenos
Ayres Avith 4,900,000 lbs. of tea, tobacco, woods,
gums, &c. in exchange for European luxuries.
It is, however, extremely difficult to establish the
precise amount of the interior trade of a country
wherein the duties of alcabala, the only sure means
of ascertaining it, are farmed out to individuals, and
Avhere the imports and exports are often landed and
shipped in a clandestine manner.

2. Imports and exports. — -At Buenos Ayres, the
annual importation of Negroes, from 1792 to 1796,
amounted to 1338 ; and the number has been pro-
bably increasing ever since. About 500 are intro-
duced annually into [[Peru]], and about 100 into
Mexico.

==[[The Progress Of Buenos Ayres And Other Spanish
Settlements On The River Plata|The progress of Buenos Ayres and other Spanish
settlements on the river Plata]]==, since they were
placed under a separate viceroy of their own, has
been most unequivocal. The fate of those pro-
vinces, for the two preceding centuries, had been
singularly hard. Debarred from a free intercourse
with Europe, lest the free importation of goods by
the river Plata should injure the trade of the gal-
leons, they had no market for their surplus pro-
duce, nor means of supplying themselves with fo-
reign commodities, except by vessels occasionally
permitted to trade with them under license, or by
the contraband commerce which, as before ob-
served, they maintained with the Portuguese.
Under the influence of this narrow and oppressive
system, they languished in poverty and obscurity
till 1778, when, after the erection of Buenos Ayres
into the capital of a new viceroyalty, the former
restrictions on its commerce were removed.

specie.

3. Coinage . — In the upper provinces of the
viceroyalty of Buenos Ayres, are situated many
valuable mines of gold and silver, of which the
celebrated mine of Potosi is the best known in Eu-
rope, though it has long ceased to merit the repu-
tation which it once enjoyed, of being the richest
and most abundant mine of the new world. The
quantity of the precious metals obtained from these
mines, may be estimated by the coinage of the
mint of Potosi ; and from the following statements,
founded upon the best attainable authorities, it
would seem that the amount of their produce has
been of late years rapidly increasing.
