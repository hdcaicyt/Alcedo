at that critical moment received fresh succours,
that were sent from Cuzco by his brother the Mar-
quis Don Francisco Pizarro, he would have fallen
a sacrifice, with the whole of the Spanish army, to
that undertaking : but being invigorated by this
assistance, he succeeded in routing the Indians,
and in obliging them to surrender to the Spanish
government. In 1539 the Marquis Don Fran-
cisco Pizarro, seeing the importance of making an
establishment here, resolved upon building of a
town, giving a commission to Captain Pedro Au-
zures to execute the same. This person actually
put into effect the plan suggested, founding the
town in exactly the same spot in which formerly
stood the settlement of Chuquisaca. Here many
of its conquerors settled and became citizens, and
they gave it the name of La Plata, or Silver, from
some mines of this metal which are found in the
mountain of Porco, which lies at a small distance
from this city, and from which the Inca Emperors
were accustomed to extract immense emolument.
Notwithstanding this name it has never lost its
original title, Chuquisaca, although indeed it is
badly pronounced by the Spaniards ; since the In-
dians, and with great propriety, will have it Cho-
quezaca, Choquechaca, or Choquisacha; all of
which, however pronounced, signify, the first,moun-
tains of gold ; the second, cunchos of gold, or
fields of brambles with yellow twigs ; and the third,
bridges of gold. Although this province is exten-
sive, it is composed of various others, which we
shall notice under their proper heads. This keeps
its present name, from being the one of all the
others the most abounding in minerals, seeds, and
cattle ; as well as being the one best peopled with
Indians. It is watered by many large rivers ; and
the whole of it composes an archbishopric, to
which arc suffragan the bishoprics of La Paz,
Santa Cruz de la Sierra, Tucuman, Paraguay,
and Buenos Ayres. It belongs to the viceroyalty
of this latter place since the time that this was
erected, and that the government was entrusted to
the royal audience established in 1559. The afore-
said district comprehends in its jurisdiction all
the following provinces and corregimientos :
Tomino, Cochabamba,

==[[Porco]]==, Chayanta,

==[[Tarija]]==, Paria,

==[[Lipes]]==, Carangas,

==[[Amparaez]]==, Cicasica,

==[[Oruro]]==, Atacama ;

==[[Pilaya]]==,

==[[In which are contained 188 settlements and cura-
cies]]==, in which there were in 1651 about 100,000
Indians. The capital of the whole jurisdiction is

the aforesaid city of Chuquisaca or La Plata. â€”
