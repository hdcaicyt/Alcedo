==[[Cumana]]==, a river of the above province and
government, which rises in the spot called Co-
coyan, in the serrama. It runs n. following this
course continually through the sierra until it
flows down to the plain near the city, from whence
it enters the gulf, first having divided itself into
four arms. In the winter time it generally over-
flows ; but as the distance from the sierra to its
mouth, or where it enters the sea, is so short, it
quickly subsides within its proper bed, when it
leaves water enough for the navigation of a barge ;
and there w ould be sufficient for large vessels, were
it not for the bar which is at its mouth and im-
pedes its entrance. In the summer time, how-
ever, it becomes so dry, tliat it is scarcely navi-
gable for canoes.

==[[Cumanacoa|CUMANACOA]]==, a city lying s. e. of Cumana
14 leagues ; in the middle of the valley of the same
name. The population amounts to 4200 people ;
the air is wholesome, the w aters have a diureticqua-
lity not commonly to be met with. This city wants
nothing but hands to avail itself of the produc-
tions which the richness of the land would yield,
if it were cultivated. The fruits have here an un-
eommonly fine savour, taste, and substance. The
government gives this city the name of San Bal-
tasar de los Arias, but that of Cumanacoa has so
much prevailed, that it is the only one by which
it is now known. See Cumana.

==[[Cumanagota|CUMANAGOTA]]==, a city of the former pro-
vince and government, in the kingdom of [[Tierra]]
Firmc, called also San Baltasar de los Arias. It
has a good, convenient, and secure port ; is
situate on the skirts of the most elevated part of
the serrama, in a fertile valley, which abounds in
streams, which irrigate 26 estates of yucales, some
small plantations of cacao, and some cattle. The
productions of all these estates are consumed in the
country ; since, through the unevenness of the
roads, it is impossible to carry^them out of it, with
the exception, however, of tobacco, with which
Cumana is supplied. The soil is the most fertile
of any in the province, especially to the n. of the
sietTa, where there might be established some very
good cacao estates ; but this is not to be accom-
plished, considering the scarcity of its inhabitants,
and their great poverty. This city, just after the con-
quest of these countries, was noted for its famous
pearl-fisheries, which were afterwards abandoned.
Its vicinity was inhabited by many gentile Indians,
who were at continual enmity with the Spaniards
and the other inhabitants ; but these troublesome
people were reduced to obedience by Don Juan de
Urpin, who had held consultations for that pur-
pose with the council of the Indies. The popu-
lation amounts to 800 souls, including the Negro
slaves and the people of colour.

try of Las Amazonas, in the territory possessed by

==[[Cumarebo|CUMAREBO]]==, a settlement of the province
and government of [[Venezuela]] ; situate on the sea-
