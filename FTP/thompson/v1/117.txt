city of the province and government of [[Cumanii]],
situate upon a plain on the skirt of the serrania,
and which is called the valley of Cariaco, and is
about eight or ten leagues in circumference. It is
very fertile, especially in maize and yucas^ which
tlie natives cultivate : of the former they usually
collect from 20 to 24,000 bushels, which is carried
by the gulph to Cumana, and other parts of the
province. This valley has 1 1 cacao estates, which
belong to the inhabitants of the city, and which
never produce more than 100 bushels : they are,
however, held in high estimation ; and when there
is a deficiency in the crops of maize, great priva-
tions are felt througho\it the settlements on the
coast ; for this valley is the granary of the pro-
vince. The population of this city is composed of
254 families ; and it is 16 leagues from Cumana.
