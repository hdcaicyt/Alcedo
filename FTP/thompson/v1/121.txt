==[[Baba|BABA]]==, a district of the province and govern-
ment of Guayaquil in the kingdom of [[Quito]], one
of the seven which compose the same, and one of
the largest, extending 22 leagues from the mouth
of the river of its name to the skirt of the moun-
tain Zamborondon, bounded by the Colarados
Indians, in the heights of the asiento and province
of Tacunga. Its territory is low, being com-
pletely inundated in the winter, and it then be-
comes necessary to take their cattle and their other
productions into what they style winter-quarters,
namely, to the very summits of the mountains ;
but in the summer it is fertile, and produces quan-
tities of pasture ; and so great is the increase of its
herds of cattle, that the natives are taught to con-
sider these inundations as one of their greatest
benefits, since hereby much cattle is carried off
and destroyed, which would otherwise overstock
the country. It is equally fertile in cacao, in
which consists its principal commerce, since it
regularly gathers to the amount of 32,000 mea-
sures of 81 pound weight each; also in canoes
which are made of one entire trunk, and often so
large as to be capable of holding 60 bushels of salt ;
in different woods ; in soap, colts, horses, and
some Camilla, and butter of cacao. In this district
grows the tree called matapalo, which destroys
every plant that may be near it, and which has
been seen of the immense size of 20 geometrical
feet in circumference. The inhabitants may
amount to about 4000, and the capital of the dis-
trict has the same name. It was situated on the
shores of the river, which, although it still exists,
has changed its course, running at present through
a distant plain, seven leagues from the town, and
leaving the inhabitants in some distress for a
means of watering their cacao plantations, and for
this reason, the productions became much dimi-
nished. Twenty leagues from the capital of the
province.

the mountains of Zamborondon in the province
of Latacunga. It runs 33 leagues till it empties
itself into the river of Guayaquil, at its mouth.

government of [[Guayaquil]] in the kingdom of
Quito, one of the seven which compose the same ;
bounded by the provinces of Chimbo and Rio-
bamba. It is a tract of country so level and so
low that it is commonly the first to be inundated
by the swelling of the rivers in the winter, which,
as they subside in the summer, leave the ground
covered with a tall, rank, and thick grass called
gamalote. It is very fertile, and abounding in
cattle of every kind ; in rice, cotton, soap, to-
bacco, cacao, honey, and fruits, with which it
carries on a great commerce, by means of its river,
with the other provinces ; so that this district is, as
it were, a continual fair, and is one of the richest
districts of the province.

==[[Bab Aho Yo|Bab AHOYo]]==, a capital settlement of the above dis-
trict, situate on the shore of the river which bears
the same name, where are the custom-houses and
royal arsenals, which are called bodegas, and in
which are deposited, for the supply of the pro-
vinces of the sierra, both its own and the produc-
tions of the ultra-marine provinces of [[Peru]], Chile,
[[Tierra Firme]], Guatemala, and Nicaragua, as
also what is brought by the muleteers who come
down from Quito, Latacunga, Ambato, Chimbo,
and Riobamba ; so that a continual fair is held
for the space of six months, the same being a ge-
neral sale of the productions of the above pro-
vince. Lat. 1° 47' s.

==[[Babahoyo]]==, a large river of the same district,
formed by the Jilca and Caluma, Avhich rise in
the mountains of Chimbo and Riobamba, and join
in the strand from whence this river takes its
name. It then runs 24 leagues, until it empties
itself into the Guayaquil. It is by means of this
that the traffic of the whole district is carried on,
and unladed in the custom-houses or royal
arsenals. The embarkations are, for the most part,
effected by rafts, which are made as folloAvs :
Upon a plain of thick and tolerably stout timbers,
consisting of a Avood very limber and as light as
cork, (corcho), from whence they take their de-
nomination, and which are united by strong pli-
able reeds, they raise some large joists of cedar,
crossing each other and forming squares, at the
extremities of which are fixed uprights of the
same for forming the Avails, roofs, &c. ; these they
cover and interweave Avith split cane, leaving
holes for the doors and windows ; then the roof
