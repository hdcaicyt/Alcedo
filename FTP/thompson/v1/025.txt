gular, for they acknoAvledge a supreme being, who,
they imagine, manifests himself to them in the
figure of some animal which feeds in their fields ;
and when this dies, tlvey substitute another, after
having signified very great demonstrations of re-
gret for the fate of the one whicli is lost.

[==[[Alabaha]]==, a considerable rlA^er of Georgia,
which pursues a s. course to thegulph of Mexico,
100 miles w. of the head of St. Mary’s river. Its
banks are low, and a trifling rain sAvells it to more
than a mile in Avidth. In a freshet the current is
rapid, and those Avho pass are in danger of being
^entangled in vines and briars, and droAvned ; they
are also in r&lt;'ul danger from great numbers of hun-
gry alligators. The country for nearly iOO miles
on each side of this river, that is to say, from the
l)ead of St. Mary’s to Flint river, Avhicli is 90
miles w. of the Alabaha, is a continued soft, miry
Avaste, affording neither water nor food for men or
beasts ; and is so poor indeed, as that the common
game of the Avoods are not found here. The
i ountry on the of Alabaha is rather preferable
to that on the e.l

verge of the river. These Indians are the remains
of the ancient Alabama nation, who inhabited the

cogulges, who conquered the former.]

[==[[Alabama Biver Is Formed By The Junction
Of The Coosa Or Coosee|Alabama Biver is formed by the junction

Tallapoosee river, at Little Tallasee, and runs in

wide at its head, and from 15 to 18 feet deep in
the driest season. The banks are about 50 feet
high, and seldom, if ever, overfloAved. Travellers
have gone down in large boats, in the month of
May, in nine days, from Little Tallasee fo Mobile
bay, Avhich is about 350 miles by water. Its banks
abound Avith valuable productions in the vegetable
and mineral kingdoms.

E. Florida, situate about 75 miles w. from St.
Augustine. It is about 15 miles over, and 50 in
circumference ; and scarcely a tree or bush of any
kind to be seen on it. It is encircled Avith high
sloping hills, covered with Avaving forests, and
fragrant orange groves, rising from an exube-
ranfly fertile soil. The ancient Alachua town
stood on the borders of this savannah ; but the
Indians mnoved to Cuscowilla, two miles distant,
on account of the unhealthiness of the former site,
occasioned by the stench of the putrid fisli and
reptile.s, in the summer and autumn, driven on
shore by the alligafors, and &lt;he noxious exhulu-
tions from the marshes of ti)e savannah. Though
the horned cattle and horses bred in these meadows
are large, sleek, sprightly, and faf, yet they are
subject to mortal diseases; such as the water rot,
or scald, occasioned by the warm Avater of the sa-
vannah ; Avhile those which, range in the high
forests are clear of this (lisonler.1 °
