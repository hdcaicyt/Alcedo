as they are approachable without the least obstruc-
tion from any intervening hill or precipice ; which
cannot be said, perhaps, of any other considerable
fall in the world. The scene around is exceed-
ingly beautiful. It is not an uninterupted plain,
where the eye finds no relief, but composed of
many gentle ascents, which, in the spring and
summer, are covered with verdure, and interspers-
ed with little groves, that give a pleasing variety
to the prospect.

==[[At a little distance below the falls is a small
island]]==, about one acre and an half, on which grow
a great number of oak trees, all the branches of
which, able to bear the weight, are in the pro-
per season of the year loaded with eagle’s nests.
Their instinctive wisdom has taught them to
choose this place, as it is secure, on account of
the rapids above, from the attacks either of man
or beast.]

[==[[Anthony’s Kill|Anthony’s Kill]]==, a western water of Hudson
river. Its mouth is seven miles above that of
Mohawk river, with which likewise it communi-
cates at the e. end of Long lake,]

[==[[Anthony’s Nose|Anthony’s Nose]]==, a point of land in the
high lands on Hudson river, in the state of [[New]]
York, from Avhich to Fort Montgomery on the
oj:)posite side, a large boom and chain was ex-
tended in the late war, which cost not less than
70,000/. sterling. It wajs partly destroyed, and
partly carried away, by General Sir Henry Clin-
ton, in October 1777. Also the name given to
the point of a mountain on the n. bank of Mohawk
river, about SO miles above' Schenectady. Around
this point rims the stage road.]

[==[[Anticosti|ANTICOSTI]]==, a barren, uninhabited island,
in the mouth of St. Lawrence river. It is, how-
(;ver, of very considerable size, being 120 miles
long, and 30 broad. The French formerly had a
settlement on this island, but at present it is unin-
habited ; nor can it ever become of much im-
portance, as it does not possess a single harbour
where a vessel can ride in safety. The wood
which grows upon it is small, and the soil is rec-
koned unfruitful; which, added to the severity of
the Avinter, Avill ever prove serious obstacles to its
colonization.]

[==[[Antietam Creek|ANTIETAM Creek]]==, in Maryland, rises by
several branches in Pennsylvania, and empties into
Potowmack river, three miles s. s. e. from Sharps-
burgh. Elizabeth and Funk’s Towns stand on this
creek. It has a number of mills and forges.]

==[[Antigona|ANTIGONA]]==, a settlement of the province and

==[[Antigosti|ANTIGOSTI]]==, a large island of the gulph of
St. LaAvrence, at the entrance of the river of this -
name, in Canada.

==[[Antigua|ANTIGUA]]==, an island of the N. sea, one of the‘
Small Antillas, called by the English^ who possess
it, Antego. It is six or seven leagues long, and
nearly the same broad. It is of difficult access
for vessels, on account of the currents and shalloAVs
with Avhich it abounds. It was first thouglrt un-
inhabitable from a supposed Avant of water ; but
the English, who established themselves in it,
discovered some fountains, and the inhabitants,
who may amount to about 900 persons, have
made many welk and cisterns for preserving the
rain water. It abounds in every kind of fish, and
one of a peculiar sort, which they call perro de
mar, or sea-dog, from its devouring the other fish,
and even the fishermen, on which account the
bathing here is very dangerous. It has some very
good ports and bays, such as the bays of St. John
and Willoughby, and the ports English and Fal-
mouth. It has also a species of sea woodcock,
which has a beak similar to that bird, the upper
part of which is much larger than the lower ; it
moves either jaw with equal ease ; and some have
been seen four feet long, and 12 inches wide to-
wards the head ; they have two fins on each side,
and a large one upon the belly, rising like the
crest of a cock, and extending from the head to
the tail : but what is most extraordinary, is the
hard beak with tAVO sharp and black horns, nearly
aninch and an half each, which the creature has
thepoAver of AvithdraAving with pleasure into its
belly, this serving as a scabbard ; it has no
scales, but a black and rough skin upon its back.
This island abounds also with a variety of birds ;
and that Avhich is the most common, is peculiarly
beautiful to behold, having the upper part of the
Avings and belly of a golden colour, the other half
and the back of sky-blue, the tail and long fea-
thers of the wings of a mixture of a very bright
red and blue, and studded with other feathers of
gold ; but the most singular feature is its head,
Avhich is covered Avith a sort of dark bonnet, fring-
ed Avith green, yellow, and clear blue ; it has
also a variegated beak ; there is a ring of white
round the eyes, and the pupil is of a beautiful yel-
low and red, having the appearance of a ruby set
in gold ; and upon the head is a plume of feathers,
of the colour of vermilllon, and others of the co-
lour of pearls. This bird is about the size of a
pheasant. — The climate is hot, unsalutary, and
is very subject to hurricanes, similar to that
