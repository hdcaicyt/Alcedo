==[[Castro|CASTRO]]==, a capital city of tlie province and
government of [[Cliiloe]] in tJie kingdom of [[Chile]];
peopled by the order of Don Lope Garcia dc Cas-
tro, governor of [[Peru]], who gave it his name in
J50Q : it lies, between two small livers, and has a
good port; is inhabited by some good and opu-
lent families, and enjoys a pleasant ,and healthy
temperature. It is also called Chjloe, and is of a
regular and beautiful form ; has, besides the pa-
rish church, a convent of monks of St. Francis,
and a bishop auxiliary to that of Santiago. It was
.sacked by the Dutch in 1643 ; is 42 leagues s. of
the city of Osorno, in lat. 42° 40' s.

==[[Castro Vi Reyn A|Castro-Vi REYN A]]==, aprovinceand corregimiento
of [[Peru]], bounded w. w. by the province ofCanete,
«. by that of Yauyos, n. e. by that of Angaraes,
and partly by the jurisdiction of Huamanga and
Huanta, m. by that of Vilcas Huaman, s. w. by
that of Lucanas, and s. s. w. and w. by that of
\^ca. It is uneven and barren, and its inhabi-
tants, on this account, amount scarcely to 6900,
although it is 22 leagues in length from e. to as,
and 25 in width n. to s. No mines have been dis-
covered here, nor are there any other roads to it
than merely such as are opened through passes in
the snow, or where no obstruction is ofered by
the copious streams which every where precipi-
tate themselves down from the mountains, and
which are particularly large in the rainy season,
which is from October to Slarch. Its productions
are wheat, maize, and potatoes; and in some
glens, where the cold is not so great, fruits and
cattle are extremely plentiful. Here are also lla~
mas, vicunas, and huanacos, the wool of which
they turn to some profit. This province is wa-
tered by rivers, some of which descend from the
provinces of the coast of the S. sea, and others
from the further side of the cordillera, running
towards the e. and entering the Maranon ; it is
also watered by the Canete, which rises from the
Chicha, and collects other streams in this province ;
by the Pisco, which rises from a lake called
.firacocha ; by the Yea, from the lake Choclo-

cocha ; and by the Calcamayo, which enters the
province of [[Vilcas]] Huaman. In all the waters of
this province, notwithstanding they are very abun-
dant, there is a great scarcity of fish, and without
doubt this arises from the cold which prevails
here. This province is but thinly peopled, and its
inhabitants are poor : they do not, we have heard,
amount to more than 7000 souls. It consists of six
curacies, to which there are 29 other settlements
annexed. Its yearly reparlimiento amounted to
86,400 dollars, and it paid an alcavala equal to
691 dollars. The capital is of the same name ; this
is a small and poor town, situate on a lofty spot,
where the cold is most intense : close to it runs a
river, which is made use of for working the mills
of the silver mines ; which, although they pro-
duce this metal of a good quality, they are by no
means well stocked with it. The town has a con-
vent of monks of St. Francis, and two large estates
called Huallanto and Huallanga, in which thera
are churches annexed to this curacy ; is 14 leagues
from Huancablica, 26 from Pisco, and 60 from

la. Long. 74° 44'. Lat. 13° 49' s. The
