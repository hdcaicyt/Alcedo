already abundant stream of the Mississippi. In

above 100 yards in circumference, composed of a
stoi'io similar to crystal, and being the loftiest of
any in the province. Its borders abound with
cattle, called a sort of wild cow, having the

neck well covered with a long and soil &gt;\ool, and
affording delicious food to the natives. By the fat

which breed here, they supply the want of oil.

municates with the division of Bed river that

Spanish fort, or mission of Adaize, that place was
named after them, being about 20 miles from them
to the s. There are now but 20 men of them re-

understand, that no nation can speak ten words of
it; but they all speak Caddo, and most of them

channel, in some places 60 feet deep, through a
quarry of white marble. Over this channel, where
deepe.st, some of the rocks remain, and form a
natural bridge. From the top of this bridge to
the water is 62 feet ; its length is about 12 or 15,
and its breadth about 10. Partly uuderthis bridge,
and about 10 or 12 feet below it, is another, which

is wider, but not so long ; for at the c. end they,
form one body of rock, 12 or 14 feet thick, and
under this the water flows. The rocks here are
mostly white, and in other places clouded, like
the coarse marble common at Lanesborough, and
in other towns in Berkshire county.]
