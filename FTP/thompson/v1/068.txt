==[[The District Of The Old Republic Of Tlaxcala|The district of the old republic of Tlaxcala]]==, in-
habited by Indians jealous of their privileges, and
very much inclined to civil dissensions, has for a
long time formed a particular government. It is
indicated in the general map of New Spain as
still belonging to the intendancy of Puebla ; but
by a recent change in the financial administration,
Tlaxcala and Guautlade las Hamilpas were united
to the intendancy of Mexico and Tlapa, and
Ygualapa separated from it.

==[[There were]]==, in 1793, in the intendancy of Pue-
bla, without including the four districts of Tlax-
cala, Guautla, Ygualapa, and Tlapa :

==[[Result of the total enumeration]]==, 508,098 souls,
distributed into six cities, 133 parishes, 607 vil-
lages, 425 farms (haciendas)^ 886 solitary houses,
(ranchos), and 33 convents, two-thirds of which
are for monks.

==[[The Government Of Tlaxcala Contained|The government of [[Tlaxcala]] contained]]==, in 1793,
a population of 59,177 souls, whereof 21,849
were male, and 21,029 female Indians. The
boasted privileges of the citizens of Tlaxcala are
reducible to the three following points; 1. The
town is governed by a cacique and four Indian
alcaldes, who represent the ancient heads of the
four quarters, still called Tecpectipac, Ocotelolco,
Quiahutztlan, and Tizatlan ; these alcaldes are
under the dependence of an Indian governor, who
is himself subject to the Spanish intendant : 2.
The whites have no seat in the municipality, in
virtue of a royal cedula, of the 16th April 1585 :
and, 3. The cacique, or Indian governor, enjoys
the honours of an alferez real. The progress
of the industry and prosperity of this province
has been extremely slow, notwithstanding the
active zeal of an intendant equally enlightened
and respectable, Don Manuel de Flon, who lately
inherited the title of Count de la Cadena. The
flour trade, formerly very flourishing, has suf-
fered much from the enormous price of car-
riage from the Mexican table-land to the Ha-
vannah, and especially from the want of beasts of
burden. The commerce which Puebla carried on

till 1710 with [[Peru]], in hats and delft ware, has en-
tirely ceased. But the greatest obstacle to the
public prosperity arises from four-fifths of the
whole property (fincas) belonging to mort-main
proprietors ; that is to saj', to communities of
monks, to chapters, corporations, and hospitals.
The intendancy of Puebla has very considerable
salt-works near Chila, Xicotlan, and Ocotlan, in
the district of [[Chiautla]], as also near Zapotitlan.
The beautiful marble, known by the name of
Puebla marble, which is preferable to that of Biza-
ron and the Real del Doctor, is procured in the
quarries of Totamehuacan and Tecali, at two and
seven leagues distance from the capital of the in-
tendancy. The carbonate of lime of Tecali is
transparent, like the gypsous alabaster of Volterra,
and the Phengites of the ancients.

==[[The indigenous of this]]==.province speak three
languages totally different from one another, the
Mexican, Totonac, and Tlapanec. The first is
jjeculiar to the inhabitants of Puebla, Cholula, and
Tlascala ; the second, to the inhabitants of Za-
catlan ; and the third is preserved in the environs
of Tlapa. Whatever may be the depopulation of
the intendancy of Puebla, its relathe population is
still four times greater than that of the kingdom of
Sweden, and nearly equal to that of the king-
dom of Aragon. The industry of the inhabi-
tants of this province is not much directed to
the working of gold and silver mines. Those
of Yxtacmaztitlan, Temeztla, and Alatlauquitepic,
in the Partido de San Juan de los Llanos, of
La Canada, near Tetela de Xonotla, and of San
Miguel Tenango, near Zacatlan, are almost aban-
doned, or at least very remissly worked.

==[[The most remarkable towns of the intendancy of
Puebla are]]==, the capital of this name, Tlascalla,
Cholula, Atlixco, Tehuacan de las Granadas,
Tepeaca or Tepeyacac, Hiiljocingo or Huexot-
zinco. Population in 1803, 813,300. Extent of
surface in square leagues, 2686. Number of
inhabitants to the square league, 301.]

title of Nuestra Senora, a town of the province
and government of [[Popayan]], founded in 1565 by
the captain Domingo Lozano. It was large and
well peopled ; but it is at present reduced to a
miserable state, by the repeated ravages committed
in it by the infidel Indians of the frontier. Twenty
leagues from Tocaima, and nine from the town of
Neiva.
