==[[Calabozo|CALABOZO]]==, or Calaboso, a settlement of

.kingdom of [[Tierra Firme]] ; founded in this cen-
tury (18th), after the establishment of the company
of .Guipuzcoa, now the Philippines, on the banks
of the river Guarico. [Calabozo is a city of re-
cent date, having been at first an Indian village,
which was increased by the Spaniards, who have
fixed their residence there, in order to be near at
hand to watch and take care of their flocks. The
company of Guipuzcoa arrogate to themselves, in

their memoirs, the merit of having given to Cala-
bozo that degree of increase which was necessary
to its being inscribed on the list of cities. Its tem-
perature is excessively hot, although very regu-
larly moderated by the «. e. breezes. The soil is
hardly proper for any thing else but grazing ; and
this is the only use they make of it. The pas-
ture is good, and the horned cattle very numerous ;
but a sort of banditti are constantly over-running
the immense plains from the jurisdiction of Cala-
bozo as far as the borders of Guarapiche, and steal
as many oxen and mules as they can, cemveying
them in safety to Guayana or Trinity. Often, in-
deed, do they kill the ox and skin it on the spot,
merely taking away the hide and the tallow. It is
thought that if prompt and vigorous measures be
not taken, the pens distant from the city (as al-
most all of them are so situate) wilt be made mere
deserts. The city is situate between two rivers,
the Guarico to the w. and the Orituco to the e.
but much nearer the former than the latter. These
two rivers, whose courses are from n. to s. join
their waters about four or five leagues above Cala-
boso ; then, at a distance of about 20 leagues, fall
into the Apure, and increase under this name the
Orinoco. When the rains force these two rivers
from their beds, which happens every year, the
inhabitants find themselves extremely distressed.
Their travelling, their work, and every thing else,
is suspended. The cattle retire to the heights un-
til the waters quit the plains, and allow them to
return to their pasturage. The streets and houses
form an agreeable prospect ; and the church, with-
out being very handsome, is decent. In 1786,
there were in Calabozo, and the five villages that
belong to it, 549 houses, 1680 white people, 1186
free Indians, not tributary, S301 persons of co-
lour, 943 slaves, 116 country houses and pens,
1872 mules, and 26,557 oxen and cows. In 1804,
the population of the city amounted to 4800 people.
It is situate in lat. 8° 54', at 52 leagues s. of
Caracas, and nearly as many h. of the (Irinoco.]
