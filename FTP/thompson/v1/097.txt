==[[This province has very fcAv rivers]]==, and only two
of any consideration, one in Ihe valley of Loa,
where the provitice is bordered by that of Ataca-
ma, and another which flows down through the
valley of Locumba, and is composed of two great
streams, which flow in directions nearly contrary
to each other, and form a very deep lake of foiU v
leagues and an half in width, at the end of which is
a deep cavity, from which issues, with an immense
force, the stream forming the river of liocumba,
which continues running with an equally abun-
dant supply. This province has to the e. a vol-
cano in a very lofty mountain, from the skirts of
which spring forth some fetid hot waters; but
what are most worthy of note are its mines. In
the mountains of the curacy of Pica, are veins of
gold, and of the finest copper, neither of which
are worked, on account of the hardness of their
temper. In the part upon the coast arc two
mountains, namely, of Chanavaya and of Huan-
tajaya, two leagues, more or less, from the sea,
and some others; all of which are very rich in
metals, which are nevertheless not worked, owing
to the scarcity of water experienced in this ter-
ritory for many leagues. The second of these
mountains is supposed to have been dug in former
times ; the attempt has been repeated in the pre-
sent age, but without method ; it being imagined
that there were no regular veins of metal in it, but
merely some lumps, since some of these had been
found lying detached in difterent parts. Of late,
however, some strata of metal have been discover-
ed, and it is seen that the lumps which were first
picked out, were only the forerunners or indica-
tors of better fortune. From hence there has been
a regular establishment of labourers, and much
riches have been, and still continue to be, extracted
from this mine ; and were it not that, owing to the
want of water, the labourers are obliged to carry
the metals to be worked at a great distance, and
through unpeopled parts, the masters would be
much enriched, the kingdom would be benefited,
and the demand for workmen much larger. This
province comprehends 46 settlements and various
ports. Its reparthnienlo used to amount to
b80,900 dollars. The settlements of this juris-
diction are.

==[[The capital is founded in a beautiful and plea-
sant valley]]==, and is about a league in length, and
on the sea shore, with a port in the middle, which
is much frequented by vessels. It is very fertile,
and abounds in productions, froth which it derives
great commerce, especially in Agi pepper, and in
glass, which it manufactures. It was anciently a
large and renowned settlement, but at present it
is reduced to a scanty population, since the time
that it was destroyed by an earthquake, in 1605,
and sacked by the English pirate, John Guarin,
in 1680, when the greater part of its inhabitants
passed over into the settlement of Tacna, which is
12 leagues from hence. It has three convents,
one of the order of San Francisco, one of La
Merced, and another of San Juan de Dios, all
very poor and badly served. It is 90 leagues
n. w. of Atacames. Long. 70° 18'. Lat. 18®
26' s.
