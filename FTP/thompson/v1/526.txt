above the level of the sea : on its summit, which
is perpetually covered with snow, is a volcano,
which burst forth in 1698, in such a dreadful man-
ner as not only to destroy the city of Tacunja,
with three fourths of its inhabitants, but other
settlements also. It likewise vomited up a river of
mud, which so altered the face of the province,
that the missionaries of the Jesuits of Maynos,
seeing so many carcases, pieces of furniture, and
houses floating down the Maranon, were persuaded
amongst themselves that the Almighty had visited
this kingdom with some signal destruction ; they,
moreover, wrote circular letters, and transmitted
them open about the country, to ascertain Avhat
number of persons were remaining alive. These
misfortunes, though in a moderate degree, recurred
in the years 1742, 1743, 1760, 1768. From the
e. part of this mountain the Napo takes its rise;
and from the s. the Cotuche and the Alagues,
which, united, form the river San Miguel, and
afterwards, with others, the Patate ; to this the
Chambo joins itself, which afterwards degenerates.
