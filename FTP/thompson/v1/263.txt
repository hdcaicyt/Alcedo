==[[These statistical accounts are highly satisfactory ;
and exhibit]]==, in a clear and convincing manner, the
benefits that have resulted to the colony under the
excellent constitution of Great Britain. No sooner
was a regular form of government established, and
the minds of the people tranquillized, than British
subjects were induced to emigrate to Canada, and
embark their property in agricultural or com-
mercial speculations. These enterprising settlers
communicated their spirit, in a certain degree, to
the old inhabitants ; and hence the surprising in-
crease of population, commerce, and agriculture,
which took place in the short period of 18 years.
Since the year 1783, the colony has been gradually
advancing in improvement. Its commerce has at
times fluctuated considerably ; but population and
agriculture have rapidly augmented. The number
of inhabitants in Lower Canada, at the present
day, is computed by Mr. Heriot at 250,000 ; but
we think this estimate is much exaggerated, for if
we calculate the population agreeably to the ratio

of its increase from 1765 to 1783, during which
period of 18 years it augmented nearly one-half,
we shall find that in 25 years, from 1783 to 1808,
the total amount will not exceed 200,000 ; and this
number, we arc of opinion, is nearest the truth.
Upper Canada is stated by Mr. Heriot to have
80,000 inhabitants : this number may possibly be
correct; butwepreferthe authorities which compute
it at only 60,000; truth, however, may perhaps
be found in the medium between the two. There
is every reason to suppose that no diminution
whatever has taken place in any part of those de-
tails ; but that the augmentation which occurred
between 1765 and 1783 has continued, with little
variation, in the same regular manner, for the last
25 years. Upon this hypothesis we shall ofler the
following statistical statement for the year 1808.
In the absence of official documents, it may afford
some idea of the resources of Lower Canada at tie
present day.

==[[Of The Inhabitants Of Lower Canada Not More
Than One Tenth Are British|Of the inhabitants of Lower Canada not more
than one-tenth are British]]==, or American settlers
from the United States. In Upper Canada the
population is almost entirely composed of the lat-
ter, and of British subjects who have emigrated
from v.arious parts of the united kingdom. Very
few French people reside in that province ; and it
is a remarkable circumstance, that among all the
British residents in the two colonies, not 200
JEnglishmen perhaps can be found. We are
told that at Quebec there are not more than
12 or 11 of that country; the rest are either Irish

or Scotch, though the former bear no proportion
to the latter, who are distributed from one end of
the Canadas to the other. The Irish emigrate
more to the United States than to Canada, and no
less than 30,000 are said to have emigrated thither
in 1801. Being discontented with their own go-
vernment, they endeavour to seek relief under a fo-
reign one, whose virtues have been so greatly ex-
aggerated, and whose excellent properties have
been extolled to the skies. A few months, how-
ever, convince them of their error, and those who
are not sold to their American masters generally] •
