by a lake of wholesome water, which gives its
name to the jurisdiction, and which, towards the
n. part, becomes dry in the summer season, its
waters being supplied from certain drains from
another large lake which lies on its s. side. The
temperature here is, for the most part, mild and
dry, and the place abounds with salutary waters,
which bubble out from a fountain in an island of
the above mentioned lake. Its commerce is very
small, since it produces only maize, French beans,
and Chile pepper, and a kind of fish found in great
abundance in both the lakes, called charaes.

the lake]]==.. It contains a convent of the religious

wards enters the river Blanco. It does not appear
to receive its waters from any source, and i«
thought to be filled through subterraneous aque-
ducts from the mountain of Cota-cacbe, which is
covered with eternal snow. In the middle of this
lake rise two hills, which have the appearance of
two beautiful isles, the one being covered with
trees, and filled with stags and mountain goats, and
the other being bedecked with a herb calledp^jow,
amongst which thrive many Indian rabbits, which,
in the language of the country, are called cuy^ and
from thence the name of Cuy-cocha, which means
the lake of Indian rabbits. The water which runs
between the two islands, forms a channel of 3000
fathoms. This lake belongs to the noble family
of the Chiribogas of Quito.
