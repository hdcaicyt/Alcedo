It is also called, Of Curnana, from this -capital being
built upon its shores. The bajr runs 10 or 12
leagues from w. to c. and is one league toroad at
its widest part. It is from 80 to 100 fathoms
deep, and the waters are so quiet as to resemble
rather the waters of a lake than those of the ocean.
It is surrounded by the serramasy or lofty chains
of mountains, which shelter it from all winds ex-
cepting that of the n. e. which, blowing on it as it
were through a straitened and narrow passage,
it accustomed to cause a swell, especially from 10

m the morning until five in the evening, after which
all becomes calm. Under the above circumstances,
the larger vessels ply to windward ; and if the
wind be very strong, they come to an anchor ou
the one or other coast, and wait till the evening,
when the land breezes spring up from the s. e. In
this gulf there are some good ports and bays, viz.
the lake of Obispo, of Juanantar, of Gurintar,
and others.

cut off' to water some cacao plantations, and then
empties itself into the sea through the former gulf.
In the winter great part of the capital, which is
situate upon its banks, is inundated, and the river
is tlien navigated by small barks or barges ; but in
the summer it becomes so dry that there is scarce-
ly water sufficient to nqvigate a canoe.

==[[Cariaco]]==, a small city of the same province,
situate on the shore of the gulf. [This city (ac-
cording to Depons) bears, in the official papers
and in the courts of justice, the name of San Fe-
lipe de Austria. The population is only 6500,
but every one makes such a good use of his time
as to banish misery from the place. The produc-
tion most natural to the soil is cotton, the beauty
of which is superior to that of all [[Tierra Firme]].
This place alone furnishes annually more than
3000 quintals ; and besides cacao they grow a little
sugar. Lat. 10° SO' n. Long. 63° 39' w.
