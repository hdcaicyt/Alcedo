==[[Caribes|CARIBES]]==, a barbarous and ferocious nation of
Indians, who are cannibals, inhabiting the pro-
vince which by them is called Caribana. They
are divided under the titles of the Maritiraos and
Mediterraneos : the former live in plains and upon
the coast of the Atlantic, are contiguous to the
Dutch and French colonies, and follow the laws
and customs of the former, with whom they carry
on a commerce. They are the most cruel of any
that infest the settlements of the missions of the
river Orinoco, and are the same as those called
Galibis. The Mediterraneos, who inhabit the
s. side of the source of the river Caroni, are of a
more pacific nature, and began to be reduced to
the faith by the regular order of the abolished so-
ciety of the Jesuits in 1738, The name of Caribes
is given not only to these and other Indians of the
Antilles, but to all such as are cannibals. See Ca-
