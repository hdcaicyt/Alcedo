Abancai ; its limits being a long chain of snow-clad
mountains ; and n. e. and n. by the cordillera of
the Andes, and mountains of the infidel Indians.
The whole of this province is a broken uneven
territory, 30 leagues in length from n. to s. and
from two to five in width. Its temperature is mild,
excepting in the heights of either side, where it is
very cold. Its productions are those of a warm and
cold climate, namely, wheat, maize, and other grain
in abundance, a variety of fruits, papas, and many
sweet-smelling flowers. Its breed ofcattle is very con-
siderable. On the e. it intersects the cordillera by
two extensive valleys, called Quillobamba andAmai-
bamba,of a warm and moist temperature, very fer-
tile, and in Avhich there are many plantations of
cancs, from which ismadethe bestsugar in the whole
kingdom. There is also in the n. e. part a pass
through the cordillera by the valleys of Ocabamba
and Lares, abounding in wild fruits, wood, ani-
mals, and insects. The fertility of this province
is so great, that the sugar-canes being once planted,
perpetuate themselves for several years, and be-
come ripe in 14 months ; their first produce being
extremely fine. There are at present no mines
worked, although formerly much silver was pro-
cured from those which are now abandoned, either
on account of their having filled with water, or
from the baseness nf the metal produced. There
are some indeed of saltpetre, which is carried to
Cuzco for the manufacture of gunpowder. The
principal river which waters it is the Vilcoraayo,
which runs through the broken ravine or valley,
and has thrown across it in various parts bridges
formed of wmker-work. The number of its inha-
bitants is 10,000 ; its repartimiento used to amount
to 63,300 dollars, and it paid yearly 508 dollars
