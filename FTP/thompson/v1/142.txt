and in the summtsr it is deep enough to be navi-
gated by bilanders ; but neither at one time nor
the other is it accessible except for small craft, on
account of the sand bank which lies at its en-
trance.

==[[Barco|BARCO]]==, Pena del, a point of the s. coast,

==[[Barichara|BARICHARA]]==, San Lorenzo de, a settle-
ment of the jurisdiction of the town of San Gil and
corregimieMo of Tunja, in the Nuevo Reyno de
Granada. It was annexed to the curacy of the
above town, and was separated from it in 1751 ;
is of a hot though healthy temperature, but very
subject to strong currents of air. It produces
sugar-cane, cotton, plantains, rice, and a mo-
derate quantity of tobacco. From these, and from
the making of cotton garments, the inhabitants
derive their principal source of commerce ; and
they should amount to 700. It is nearly upon the
shore of the river of the Mochuelo, two leagues
from the town of San Gil.

==[[Barima|BARIMA]]==, a small river of the province and
government of [[Cumana]] in the kingdom of [[Tierra]]
Firme ; it rises in the middle of the sierra of Ima-

of the Orinoco, which, on account of its size, is
called De Navios.

==[[Barima]]==, a point or strip of land of the same
province and government ; it is one of those which
form the principal mouth of the river Orinoco,

==[[Barinas|BARINAS]]==, a city of the government of [[Mara]]-
caibo, founded in 1576 by Juan Varela, on the
shore and at the source of the river of St. Domin-
go, is famous for the tobacco which it produces,
and which is esteemed the very best ; is of an ex-
tremely hot temperature, but very fertile, and
abounds in the above article and cacao, both of
which are carried to Caracas, and sold at the rate
of 20 dollars a carga. It abounds in neat cattle,
and in some of its estates are upwards of 30 or
40,000 head, and an equal number of horses and
mules of an excellent quality ; also in sugar-cane :
and it has many mills for the manufactures of this
article and brandy. There are quantities of maize,
plantains, yucas, uyamas, potatoes, curas, and
names, which latter is a species of root like truf-
fles, grows spontaneously, and comes to such a
size as to be of a pound weight : it is, consequent-
ly, the custom to cut away parts of it for use, with-

out pulling up the whole root at once : of the yu-
cas is made cazave, which is the common bread.
In the level plains are found a remarkable number
of pines, water melons, which are called palillas ;
other melons, annonas, tucuraguas, of a very fine
smell, and which have the property of causing fe-
vers ; and plaintains of many sorts. In the moun-
tains are woods of cacao trees, which grow with-
out being sown, the nuts of which are small. There
are also found groves of limes and oranges, exten-
sive mountains of exquisite woods, some of de-
licious fragrance and aromatic gums, others of an
excessive hardness and durability, such as cedars,
granadillos, red and black, here called cana-
gMÂ«fe,and many herbs, fruits, and medicinal roots ;
the espongilla fruit, which being infusetl in water,
is an excellent and certain purgative ; the pasalla
root, and the zarzaparilla. This territory has
many navigable rivers, and in them an abundance
of excellent fish, trout, tortoises, morrocoyes, sea-
calves, and alligators. The parish church is good,
but the city is reduced, owing to its inhabitants,
who amount to about 300 house-keepers, having
agreed, for the most part, to remove themselves to a
spot at some distance, and to their having already
in a great measure put their design into execution.
In its jurisdiction, and in the jurisdiction of the
town of Pedraza, are eight settlements of missions
or reducciones of Indians, which are under the care
of monks of St. Dominic. Notwithstanding all the
advantages this city enjoys, it is much infested
with swarms of mosquitoes of various sorts, spi-
ders, snakes, lice, and various other sorts of
noxious and filthy vermin. Its heat also is ex-
cessively troublesome. This city had formerly the
name of Altamira de Caceres, from the governor
Francisco de Caceres ; and at his order it was
founded by Juan Varela, at the top of a sierra,
which served it as a wall. It had only two en-
trances, the one leading out to the llanos to the s. e,
and the other to the n. w. which facilitated the
communication with the cities of Merida and Trux-
illo. After some years, when the infidel Indians
retired from its territory, the inhabitants removed
the settlement to the s. side of the river St. Do-
mingo, upon a spacious table-land theretofore
called Moromy, but afterwards Barinas, this be-
ing the name of that territory. There it remained
until the year 1646, when some of the religious
order of St. Dominic, having pacified the Indians
who remained, established diflferent estates, and
founded various settlements, under the assistance
of an escort of troops. Again the Captain Miguel
de Ochagavia, native of this city, in 1634, having
discovered the navigation of the rivers Apure and
