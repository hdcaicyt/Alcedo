selves from the plagues of the venomous serpents,
ants, mosquitoes, and other insects, agreed to be-
take themselves to a certain level plain, and actu-
ally departed in 1752, under the permission of Don
Joseph de Solis, viceroy of Santa Fe. The city
was then founded on a spacious plot of ground, of
an healthy temperature, of a pure air and atmos-
phere, at the distance of a quarter of a league from
the river of Sts Domingo, which runs to the n. of
the city, the king approving this translation in the
letters patent of 1760. In the old city there was
a bouse of entertainment belonging to the monks
of St. Augustine, which was broken up in 1776,
and two hermitages, called El Calvario and San
Pedro, which were ruined by an earthquake in
1740. At the present day it has only, in addition
to the parish church, one hermitage, with the de-
dicatory title of Santa Barbara ; being however
authorised to build another, with the title of N ues-
tra Seiiora del Carmen. In the former year, 1785,
the king thought it worthy to be erected into a
province and government, independent of, and
situate from, that of Maracaibo, subject to the in-
tendancy and captainship-general of Venezuela,
and in its ecclesiastic concerns, to the bishopric
newly erected in Merida. Its district abounds in
neat cattle, mules, and horses ; also in sugar, to-
bacco, cotton, and some cacao; and, for some little
time past, there have been here some rich establish-
ments of indigo, which, for its quality, is highly
esteemed in all parts. Its missions have always
been of the religious order of St. Dominic, of the
province of [[Santa]] Fe. Sixteen leagues to the e. of
Merida. [The chief officer at Barinas has but the
title of political commander, although his functions
in his district are the same, in civil, military, and
religious matters, as those of other governors.
His salary is also the'same as theirs, 4000 piastres
fortes. The increase, of late years, of this part of
the province, open to invasion by the navigable
rivers which flow into the Orinoco, was the reason
of the establishment of this government ; and for
its better defence, a militia Avas formed in 1803, and
the city was furnished Avith a garrison consisting of
a company of troops of the line newly raised, and
compossd of 77 men. The city of Barinas has
been long knoAvn in the European markets for its
tobacco, AA hich, from prejudice, is considered su-
perior to all other, but, in reality, it is inferior in
every respect to that cultivated in other places,
and particularly in Cumanacoa in the provisice of
Cumana. The prepossession in its favour is never-
theless so great, that at Amsterdam or Hamburgh,

tobacco of any other description, Avhatever may be
its quality, sells for 20 or 25 per cent. less. The
Spaniards being aware of this, all tobacco, from
whatever province it may be produced, is shipped
by them under this recommendatory title, and tlie
European purcliaser experiences no loss from the
deception. It is observed of late, that the tobacco
of Barinas is more subject to spoil than any other.
Hardly is the hist process of preparation finished
when a destructive Avorrn gets into the heart of the
plant, corrodes the interior of it, and converts it
into a powder ; the surface appears but slightly in-
jured, and the injury is therefore more difficult to
discover. The inhabitants, for a long time intent
solely on the cultivation of tobacco, conceived that
the country was not capable of yielding any thing
else, but at present they groAV, or endeavour to
grow, every thing. The produce is transported in
a great degree by Avater to the Guayana ; the place
of loading is on the Portuguese river, five leagues
below the city, and is called Torunos. The air of
the city is very pure, although Reaumur’s thermo-
meter is seldom below 24°. The inhabitants are
computed at 10,000. Barinas lies 100 leagues
5. s.e. of Caracas. Lat. 7°S5'«. Long. 70° 15' re.]

another city of the same province and government,
founded on the shore of the river of St. Domingo,
as is also the other, but lower down than the
former.

==[[Bariquisimeto|BARIQUISIMETO]]==, or Nueva Segovia, a
city of the province and government of [[Venezuela]]
in the kingdom of [[Tierra Firme]], founded in 1552
by Captain Juan de Villegas on the shores of the
river Buria, with the name of Nueva Segovia, in
the vicinity of the gold mines Avhich are in the val-
ley of Nirua, to the e. of Tucuyo ; but its bad
climate and scarcitj'^ of every necessary induced
the Governor Villacinda to remove it tivo leagues
from Tucuyo ; from Avhence it Avas again removed
by Pablo Collado to a spot lying betAveen the river*
Turbio and Claro ; and a third time, by the Go-
vernor Manzaneda, to where it still remains, on
some lofty llanuras. These are very open, and
abound in all the fruits peculiar to Castilie, in ex-
cellent wheat, which is gathered in the valley of
Quibon. The soil of this Valley is extremely hot,
but pleasantly irrigated by a stream flowing from a
chasm or cleft in the serrama, Avhere the natives
often betake themselves during the summer nights
to repose, on account of its refreshing coolness. It
has a very good parish church, in Avhich there is a
very fine and miraculous image of our Saviour
crucified, and to which singular respect is paid ;
also a convent of Franciscan monks. This city
