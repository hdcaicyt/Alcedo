[jected. These remonstrances induced the new
court of Lisbon, in 1647, once more to renew their
orders against [[Brasil|Brazil]]ian slavery. The internal
slate of tiie colony, however, and a risina; spirit
of independence whicli bewail io pervade all ranks
among the colonists, induced that weak power to
compromise their just decrees, and permit those
individuals who were born of a Negro mother and
an Indian fatiicr, to be retained in slavery. Tired
al last with tire languid labours of the unfortunate
natives, the colonists gradually began to supply
their place with African slaves, except in a few of
the poorer captainships, where they were inca-
pable of purchasing them ; and notwithstanding va-
rious edicls of the government, issued during the
early part of the last century, this remnant of bar-
barism continued to prevail in these districts till
1755, at which period the Indians without excep-
tion were declared citizens. The same road was
opened to them as to their conquerors for the ex-
ercise of their talents, and they were suffered to
aspire to the highest offices and dignities in the
colony. Various circumstances, however, pre-
vented or retarded the good effects which might
have been expected to result from this political
amelioration of their condition ; but the most
powerful of these is, perhaps, the want of a free
intercourse between them and the Portuguese.
Most of the Indians live in separate villages, over
which an European presides, who is invested with
the power of directing all their concerns, and of
punishing or rewarding them according to their
deserts. He, in pursuance of the plan that had
been laid down by the Jesuits, but certainly with
less regard to the spiritual welfare of these poor
creatures, superintends the sale of all commodities
in behalf of the community, delivers to the go-
vernment agents the tenth part of the territorial
products, and appoints the portion of labour to
be performed by those who have fallen into a state
of vassalage; and these agents act under the di-
rection of a chief, to whom is delegati d still more
extensive authority. See each captainship, as enu-
merated at the beginning of tl)is article.]
