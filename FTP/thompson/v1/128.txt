[==[[Bald Eagle Valley|Bald Eagle Valley]]==, or, as it is commonly
called, Sinking Spring Valley, lies upon the fron-
tiers of Bedford county in Pennsylvania, about
200 miles w. from Philadelphia. It has on the
e. a chain of high, rugged mountains, called the
Canoe Ridge, and on the w. the Bald Eagle or
Warrior mountains. Tliis is a pleasant vale, of
limestone bottom, five miles in extent where widest;
and in the vicinity are great quantities of lead ore.
It contained, in 1779, about 60 or 70 families,
living in log-houses, who formed, in the space of
seven or eight years, several valuable plantations,
some of which are remarkably agreeable on ac-
count of their situation. During the late war with
Great Britain, lead was much wanted, and very

difficult to be procured, which induced a com-
pany, under the patronage of the state, to settle
here, and establish a regular set of works. A fort
of logs was erected for the protection of the miners ;
and a considerable quantity of ore was produced,
from which lead enough was made to give a
competent idea of the real value of the mines in
general. The danger of the situation, however,
while an Indian war continued, occasioned the
failure of the undertaking. The lead ore was of
many kinds ; some in broad flakes, and others of
the steely texture. Several regular shafts were
sunk to a considerable depth ; one of which was
on the hill upon which the fort was erected, and
from which many large rriasses of ore were pro-
cured ; but not forming a regular vein, it was dis-
continued, and another opened about a mile from
the fort, nearer to Frank’s Town. Here the
miners continued until they finally relinquished
the business. When they first began, they found
in the upper surface or vegetable earth several
hundred weight of cubic lead ore, clean and un-
mixed with any substance whatever, which con-
tinued as a clue, leading them down through the
different strata of earth, marl, &c. until they came
to the rock, which is here in general of the lime-
stone kind. Among other curiosities of this place,
is that called the Swallows, which absorb several of
the largest streams of the valley, and after convey-
ing them several miles under ground, in a sub-
terrananeous course, return them again upon the
surface. These subterraneous passages have given
rise to the name Sinking Spring valley. Of these
the most remarkable is called the Arch springs,
and run close upon the road from the town to the
fort. It is a deep hollow formed in the limestone
rock, about 30 feet wide, with a rude natural stone
arch hanging over it, forming a passage for the
water, which it throws out with some degree of
violence, and in such plenty as to form a fine
stream, which at length buries itself again in the
bowels of the earth. Some of these pits are near
SOO feet deep ; the water at the bottom seems in
rapid motion, and is apparently as black as ink,
though it is as pure as the finest springs can pro-
duce. Many of these pits are placed along the
course of this subterraneous river, which soon
after takes an opportunity of an opening at a
declivity of the ground, and keeps along the sur-
face among the rocky hills for a few rods, then
enters the mouth of a large cave, whose exterior
aperture would be sufficient to admit a shallop
with her sails full spread. In the inside it keeps
from 18 to 20 feet wide. The roof declines as you
advance, and a ledge of loose rugged rocks extends
