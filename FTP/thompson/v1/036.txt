tal,

==[[Alto]]==, San Anuhes del, another settlement in
the province and government of [[Popajan]], of the
kingdom of [[Quito]].

==[[Altobelo|ALTOBELO]]==, a lofty, sharp-pointed island,
near the n. coast of [[Hispaniola]], discovered at a
great distfince, and lying between the point Beata
and the island of [[Vaca]]. [Long. 71° 18' n. Lat.

[==[[Alton|ALTON]]==, a tract of land in Straftbrd county,
New Hampshire, n. e. from Barnstead.]

==[[Altos|ALTOS]]==, a settlement of the province and cap~
taimhip of S. Vincente in [[Brasil|Brazil]], situate between
those of Tributes and Porcon.

==[[Altos]]==, another settlement in the province and
captainship of [[Rey]] in the same kingdom, and on
the shore of the river Curucay.

==[[Altos]]==, a river of the province and government
of Guanuco in [[Peru]]. It is small, runs from s. to
n. and forming a curve towards the w. enters the
sources of the river Guallaga, opposite the settle-
ment of Saramajos.

==[[Altotonga|ALTOTONGA]]==, a settlement of the head settle-
ment of the district of [[Xalacingo]], and alcaidia
Tna^or of Xalapa, in [[Nueva España]]; situate in a
fertile, beautiful, and spacious valley, from which
it takes its name. It is of a mild temperature,
abounding in fruits, pulse, and tobacco. It con-
tains 105 Spanish families. The word Altotonga
signifies, in the Mexican language, hot and saltish
water ; and this comes from a river which has its
rise in two hills united to each other, and situate
at a league’s distance to the s. This river runs into
the lake of Alchichica, of the jurisdiction of Te-
peaca. It lies a league and a half s. e. of its head
settlement.

==[[Alva|ALVA]]==, San Luis de Laicacota de, an
establishment of silver mines, celebrated for
their riches, in a mountain of this name, which
signifies enchanted lake ; there being a lake at the
top of the mountain formed by the Indians, who
made use of it as a place in which to deposit and
conceal their riches. This place was discovered
in 1657 by the Colonel Don Joseph de Salcedo,
who, having received some vague rumours of its
importance, and finding that there was little need
of hands for the working the mountain of San
Joseph, sent his men hitherto work. They ac-
cordingly opened the ground, and having suc-
ceeded in finding some metals of a superior quality,
contrived to let off the lake, so as to come to the
principal vein. Here they discovered an im-

mense quantity of silver, which they dug out at a
trifling expence. They also found the mouths of
other mines ; namely, of those of Las Animas and
Laicacota Baxa, which were contiguous, and
equally rich. From the last of these, Salcedo
took, in one night, 93 casks full of silver, valued
at a hundred thousand dollars, also a massy lump
of silver, which weighed seven arrohas. The me-
tal was, moreover, so fine and pure, that, after
paying the quinto or duty to the king, it was
coined into money without any previous refine-
ment. From these riches the disgraces of Salcedo
took their origin ; it was from them that arose the
bickerings and party spirits xvhich appeared
among the Andaluces and Criollos on one side,
and the mountaineers and the Viscauios on the
other. A battle was the consequence, and the
plain was covered with dead bodies. The plain
bears the same name (Alva), and is, to this day,
strewed with whitened bones. This disastrous
affair induced the viceroy, the Count of Lemos,
to come in person to put a stop to these differences ;
and he, upon his arrival, ordered the settlement,
which consisted of upwards of 300 houses, to be
laid waste ; and finding a pretext for the removal
of the Colonel Salcedo, caused him to undergo his
sentence in the city of Lima, in 1686 ; but, as the
sentence was about to be put into execution, it
happened, and, as it is believed, by the decree of
heaven, which would bear testimony to his inno-
cence, that the mine became inundated ; so that it
could never after be emptied ; and although vast
suras have been employed upon this work, no sil-
ver has ever since been extracted.

==[[Alvarado|ALVARADO]]==, a very abundant river of Nueva
Espana, forming itself from one which descends
from the sierras of Zongolica and Misteca. All
these three unite near the settlement of Cuyote-
pcque, in the alcaidia mayor of [[Cozaraaloapan]],
and collecting the streams of many others, which
swell it to an immense size, it enters the sea at the
mouth of its name, 12 leagues from Vera Cruz.
It was anciently called Papaloapan, and was the
first that was discovered by Herrian Cortes. It
has a battery at its entrance, guarded by a detach-
ment from Vera Cruz.

==[[Alvarado]]==, a settlement of the jurisdiction and
alcaidia mayor of [[Vera]] Cruz in [[Nueva España]].
It is of a hot and dry temperature, inhabited by
60 families of Spaniards and Mulattoes, whose
commerce consists in fish ; as the land, although
naturally fertile, yields no productions by which
their commerce might be enlarged. They have a
church, in which the image of our Lady of Con-
