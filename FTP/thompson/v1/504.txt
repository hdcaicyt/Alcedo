on the banks of the river of its name, near where
this river joins that of Florido. It is garrisoned
by a captain, a lieutenant, a serjeant, and 33 sol-
diers, to guard against the irruptions of the infidel
Indians. In its vicinity are the estates of La Ci-
enega, Sapian, and El Pilar. Fifty-eight leagues

==[[Conch Ucos|CONCH UCOS]]==, a province and corresimiento
of [[Peru]] ; bounded n. by the province of [[Huama]]-
chucos, n. e. by that of Pataz, and separated from
thence by the river Marafion, e. and s. e. by the
province of Huraalies, and s. by that of Caxa-
tambo. It is 52 leagues in length, and in some
parts 20 in width. It is of a very irregular figure,
and of various temperature, according to the dif-
ferent situation of its territories ; cold in all the
parts bordering upon the cordil/era, mild in some
parts, and in others excessively hot. It is 'V-ery
pleasant, and it has all kinds of fruits, which it
produces in abundance, and in the same manner
wheat, barley, and pot herbs. On its skirts are
found numerous herds of cattle of every species,
and from the wools of some of these are made the
cloth manufactures of the country, which meet
with a ready demand in the other provinces. The
principal rivers by which it is watered are three ;
and these are formed by various streams : the one
of them enters that of Santa to the zo. and the
other two the Marafion. The most s. is called De
Miraflores, and the other, which is very large,
keeps the name of the province. Here are some
mines of silver, which were formerly very rich ;
as also some lavaderos, or washing places of gold,
of the purest quality, the standard weight of it
being 23 carats. Also in the curacy of Llamelin
are some mines of brimstone, and a fountain or
stream, the waters of which, falling down into a
deep slough, become condensed and converted into
a stone called Catachi, in the form of columns much
resembling wax-candles, of a very white colour.
The same substance is used as a remedy against
the bloody flux, and it is said, that being made
into powders, and mixed Avith the white of an egg,
it forms a salve which accelerates in a Avonderful
manner the knitting of fractured bones. It com-
prehends 15 curacies, Avithout the annexed settle-
ments, all of Avhich, the former and the latter, are
