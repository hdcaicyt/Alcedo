of several smaller rivers, runs from s. to n.
until it unites itself with tlie Gonzanama, which
enters it on the s. side, in lat. S° 47' s. ; it then
turns its course to the xo. and afterwards to the
5 . w. and receives the tributary streams of the
rivers Quiros, Macara, and Pelingara ; all of
which enter it on the s. side. Being swelled with
these, it takes the name of Amotape, from the settle-
ment of this name, situate on its shore. Near its
mouth this river is called Colan, and it empties it-
self into the sea in the corregimiento and province
ofPiura. The countries which it laves are fertile
and beautiful, and its banks are covered with or-
chards and plantations of sugar-canes of the terri-
tory of Loxa. The climate here is very hot, and
in the valleys formed by this river the inhabitants
are much afflicted with the tertian fever ; its wa-
ters are generally very cold and unwliolesonic.
